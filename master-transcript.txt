Welcome to Back on the Broomstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimmooire, where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots after a long period of mundanity. >> We're rewalking the path of the wise, and trying out all the latest spells, rituals, and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices. >> So, grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron, and your crystals, >> and join us as we get back on the broomstick. Hi, and welcome to Back on the Broomstick. I'm this is the third installment of our seven-part series on deity. This episode, we'll be discussing the sage aspect of the god, the elder god, the wise one, the god of death, and the dark half of the year. And I'm Shell. And before we get started, Ila has an email that she says that I must hear. So, out of the fact that I I don't I I don't have a lot of patience and I don't wait well, we're going to jump right into this email because I need to know what it's about and why I need to hear it. Well, that sounds like a perfect way to start this episode. This was written by one of our listeners in regards to I believe it was the father god and the title of this is no palm and coconut needed. In that episode, we were talking about the different aspects of the god, the oak king and the holly king. And a few listeners had mentioned that those plants didn't resonate with them, that their seasons, that their environment, their climate did not allow for an oak king or holly king. And so, what could they do instead? And we had some really good ideas, I thought. And one of the ones >> I thought we did. >> Yeah. And one of the things that you said, Shell, slightly tongue and cheek, but also very seriously, was to look at your local plants. And you talked about Hawaii, which is one of your favorite places, and you mentioned uh coconuts and palm trees, and maybe use something like that. Right. >> Right. >> So, this lovely person, I'm just going to use their initials, KJ. KJ wrote to us and she lives in Hawaii and she loved the whole episode and says that she's gonna get a little bit of God in her life because she's been working with the goddess a lot. And after listening to our episode, she agrees she needs a little bit of balance and she says she needs a little drive and some big dick energy in her life right now. So, so we feel that. But here's the part I wanted you to hear. She says, "Shell, you said if you were in Hawaii, you would substitute the palm and coconut for the non-native trees, and you could do that, but Hawaiian lore already has an equivalent. As I'm sure you know, there are a handful of gods in the pantheon, but two in particular are relevant here. Ku, the fiery, aggressive god of war, politics, strength, and masculinity, and Lono, the peaceful god of agriculture, fresh water, and abundance. each rules in his own time of the year. And I love this. I looked them up a little. >> I love that. >> And they are definitely a beautiful way to incorporate the witches wheel of the year idea of the oak king and the holly king with local representations that fit with your climate. >> I love them. >> Yeah. Isn't that fantastic? >> Oh, I love that so much. >> So, their stories are very interesting. And right now is the season of Lono. Now KJ says that she's not Hawaiian, although she lives there. So she says, you know, take this all with a little grain of salt. She's just repeating what she has learned. But she says that right now they're they're in Makahiki, which is the rainy season. And that's Lono's season. So right now it's it's Lono's time of year. >> I love that. >> Yeah. And actually during Lono's time of year, he's more like the young god, like the oak king, I would say, the growing things, right? >> Uhhuh. And during his time of year, war was actually prohibited. >> Really? >> Yeah. It was a time for people to come together in peace and they could make tributes. She says they would quote, "Come together to make tributes to Lono, play games and do sports and suspend some of the usual social rules." And this lasted from about October to February. >> No, I was just going to say I I love a lot of that tradition. Um, and I think it is it is a prime example of no matter what mythos you follow, no matter what culture that interests you, you're going to find the same concepts everywhere just with a different name. Perhaps >> these concepts are are universal. These are archetypes that we all go through because it's not that Gardner and Murray and all these people came up with Wikah and just invented it for fun. These are all universal ideas of our life. It's archetypes of who we are and how we live and and how we want to show up in the world. And so it really represents us as well as the cycle of seasons. And you will find us and the seasons everywhere you go. So fitting it to you and your culture and your local area is very very important. >> I love that. I love that so much. What a great example. >> I have another one for you. >> Okay, >> so this one was from a comment on our YouTube and it was actually something I had been thinking about quite a bit. So they literally got a whole essay because I'd been thinking about doing an update on this. But um this was on the Young God, the first episode in the series. This person is brookny_do and they said on our YouTube in my Baltic culture the sun is a goddess and the moon is a god. So as a secular witch it's hard for me to connect with the moon because seeing western content I see the femininity but then the disconnect happens when I remember it's a male figure in my folklore. He has phases because he cheated on the sun and was judged and punished by the thunder/justice god. Interesting story. She says, "Not sure how to work with that." So, my essay was basically repeating a little bit what we had kind of talked about in the last episode here. And that was really what we just said about, you know, the Hawaiian gods. It's okay to flip that and substitute it. The cycles of the moon can have that be a masculine cycle. It doesn't have to be feminine. But I I could see from this person's perspective especially how it can be a little more difficult because everything you read is telling you the exact opposite. Every every knowledge source is telling you the opposite unless it is directly related to your culture. So that I can see where that would be difficult. But I think it's just a matter of how you compartmentalize it in your head. You know what I mean? >> Yeah. And I know this is a different example. This isn't quite the same weight as deity, but I'm going to compare it to you and I with our suit of tarot cards. For us, swords are fire. >> Wands are air and swords are fire. >> That's right. Exactly. Wands are air and swords are fire. And depending on your belief system, it's one or the other. But a lot of traditional tarot information goes with swords, air, wands, fire, which is opposite to how we believe. >> Right. >> So what I do, and I think you do too, Shell, is we just kind of substitute in our minds how that works. >> Right. Right. >> And because I'm very comfortable in my theory of working, in how it works for me. I've worked with this system. I've journaled this system. I've I've read with this system. I've studied this system. my way and found how well it works for me, so I'm comfortable in it. So, it's okay to hear someone else's version and kind of flip that a little bit. >> Yeah, it's kind of just how you you turn it around in your head. I I wouldn't shy away from doing that, right? >> Going back to the Hawaii mythos, you know, if you're reading stuff about the Oak King and the Holly King, just in your mind be thinking of the other two deity, >> Cool and Lono, >> that are relevant to you. Yeah. And you know, think of that same storyline and that same plotline but with your deity. >> Exactly. And I think this gives you a much richer pool to pull from. Having your own mythos, having a familiar cultural local family mythos that's different than the commonly accepted one in my mind doesn't so much clash as give you more. It gives you more to draw from. These analogies like we found out with Ku and Lono fitting with the oak king and the holly king. The god Menace, I apologize if I'm saying that wrong. In the Baltic culture, Menace is the moon god. You can see him growing in strength as the moon grows in strength. And then he has a young phase and he has a new face phase of the old god, the death part of the god. So it still follows that cycle. You can still see the similarities in the themes even if the genders are swapped. >> Exactly. So, it's just kind of how how you flop that in your head to suit your belief system. >> Yeah. And just add to it. Maybe sometimes the moon is feminine to you. Maybe sometimes the moon is masculine to you. That's okay. Just do what's working for you in that moment where you feel that magic. >> Maybe that changes for you. Maybe, you know, in the beginning of the year, you're feeling that masculine moon energy, but towards the latter half of the year, you're feeling that feminine moon energy. >> Do what feels right to you >> and study it, work with it. What I recommended to the YouTube listener was to follow, >> you recommended them to journal it. I know you did. I was going to try and not use that word, but yeah, the way I was going to phrase it without saying journaling was that they should follow a year-long cycle. Follow a year of moon cycles as a god. So, every month you will honor that god in all of his phases and do that for a year, a whole year of lunar cycles, and then worship the goddess as the sun in that seasonal year-long light and dark solar phase, that solar cycle. So, you have to really do it for a year. You have to commit. You can't just Well, you could, but it >> Yeah, you shouldn't just halfass it. You should go into it expecting to do this whole cycle for at least a year. Experience it for a year in that aspect and see how that feels. See what works best and works for you. >> I like that concept a lot and it actually it almost makes me want want to make that commitment. I'm just not there right quite yet. Maybe next year. Um, but just because I'm so used to the opposite concept to just experience that, I've never delved into the aspect of the goddess and the sun. And that now that someone's pointed it out to me, I'm like, "Huh, that's intriguing. Now I feel like I need to go down that rabbit hole." The other thing you can do is maybe for a whole year cycle, maybe you want to worship a sun god and a moon god. Maybe you want to worship a sun goddess and a moon goddess as opposites for the year. Because we are all everything. There's masculine and feminine in everything. So, you can find that balance even if you're working with two goddesses or two gods. It doesn't have to be exact opposites. You can still find that balance in goddess or in God. >> And it also doesn't have to be the way someone else wrote it in a book. >> Exactly. Exactly. Your lived experience is the most important thing when you are forming a personal relationship with deity. So that being said, let's talk about the sky daddy. The big father figure with the white beard in the clouds. The sage god. I like how you start that with sky daddy. >> Well, they all are, right? When you think old god, they're all like some white bearded dude up in the sky. You've got Zeus with the lightning bolt. You've got >> You got Odin. >> Odin, the patch, the white beard. Who else is up? You've got Yahweh, the Christian god. He's white beard up in the clouds, right? >> Santa, he's up north. He's white beard up north. >> You know, I think Santa has almost reached that level of deity. >> I really do. I really do. >> Folklore and agrees. >> I would vote for that. I would vote for that. >> Kind of all meld together. I think an argument could be made for that. All right, I'll allow it. >> Thank you. Thank you. >> Motion passes. >> When I think of this phase of the God, this stage of the God, those are all the things that immediately come to mind. You know, that older, wiser, lifelived person, you know, full of knowledge, full of experience, ready to kind of show you the way whether you want to listen or not. This is the grandfather. This is the teller of tales. the one who has the wisdom, the knowledge, the stories, the teacher, the sage. >> But I also get visions of the hermit, too. >> Oh gosh, yes. And also, he's the god of the dead. He's the one who is there when the summer god is cut down. He guides you to the land of the dead. He's Anubis. He's Hades. He's Osiris, the god of the afterlife. He's Shiva. Life and death, right? >> The reaper of sorts. >> There you go. Yeah. He's all those things. So he's like the kindly grandpa that's going to tell you stories and bounce you on his knee and he's the reaper of death. So little bit of everything. >> Yeah. Yeah. But I also I also when I think of that phase of the god I think of a deep sense of knowledge or a source of deep knowledge on a different level than the first two phases. And I would say the same thing about the crone. It's that wise grandparent, you know, who's who's seen it all, done it all, knows it all, and and all you have to do is pick their brain to get it kind of person kind of entity. >> Yeah. And we've talked a lot with the god about different parts of the wheel as, you know, different segments. It's kind of a big slide. It's not really well-defined sections. And and Odin kind of falls into that when we're talking about the sage god on the younger father warrior god side. He's that fiery Odin the conqueror, right? He goes around, he's the fighter, he's the warrior, he's bloodthirsty. But then when he's more towards the sage god side, he's wise. He's sacrificing to bring language and runes to people. He's wisdom and learning and knowledge. So that's kind of like the two sides there of Odin on that scale. And I think even further, if you go further on the old god side of the sage god's side, like how many of us have a grandfather who's a goofy little kid, >> right? Who's cracking dumb jokes and being super silly? That's because he's that close to the young god, to the youth god. As that sage, he's also on that end right next to the brand new baby god. He is also really close to being that one. So that young god again. And so he's, you know, sometimes silly, >> but I also see see this aspect as kind of the youth and the in the father aspect of the god were kind of boisterous and outgoing and out. And with the father god, you get that sense of work and and and work ethic. With this stage, I kind of get that more turning inward self-reflective kind of that reflecting on experience past and how to kind of turn that into some eternal wisdom. I guess the wisdom of the ancestors and just like the god reflects us, his story is the solar story most of the time. His story is the solar story of the wheel of the year. So we are now in the dark half of the year and we feel it right now. The God is alone right now. We know we're in the dark half. And this is the time when we say, "Go within, reflect, look for that wisdom." And he's right there. >> And we talk a lot about Pphanany this time of year, but sometimes we fail to remember Hades this time of year. >> Hades is right there walking with you. >> Yeah. >> He's kind. He's going to walk you through this season of death. He's going to tell you to reflect. What do you want to let go of? What do you want to bury in the cold and the dark so that it grows in the spring? And he has the wisdom to help you make those decisions. >> And as much as is there is that that loving, caring aspect, he still is walking you through the season of death regardless of whether you like it or not. Here we go. >> Yeah. Exactly. And and he's going to point things out to you bluntly and coldly. Your grandfather doesn't have time for you to guess or to sort through the riddles. A lot of times he's going to be very blunt. If someone's going to tell you the truth, it's going to be your grandpa. You know, if you're messing up, grandpa's going to let you know. >> But I think I I think it it's more in like a reflective kind of way in a >> teaching >> learn lessons from actions past. you know, hey, I did this and this and the result was this. Is that what I wanted? Is, you know, what's the lesson here? >> Learn from my mistakes. >> Yeah. Taking experiences had and turn them into lessons learned. >> I love that. I love that. Yeah. Learn learn from my mistakes. Learn from my wisdom. >> Where the other two aspects of the god aren't quite thinking that far ahead yet, >> right? No, they have other immediate concerns, other priorities. Right. >> Yeah. Other things taking their attention. Whereas the sage god, his whole priority is reflection and knowledge and you know reflecting forward and back and handing off that information and sharing that knowledge. He is still a protector more in the sense of he wants to protect what he has earned. He wants to help you protect what you have grown. He wants to help you continue forward. His job even as a reaper of souls is to help life move forward. You can't have new life if you don't have death. So even in that aspect, he is still trying to help you move forward by by shedding what no longer serves you by letting go of things whose time has passed. That's an important part of growth and of life. And so in that aspect, he is still helping you grow. >> I think with this aspect of of the god, it's more about what are you learning along the way? It's more about kind of the journey than the destination. What are you learning step by step by step and how are you either using that to to move forward and grow or learn a lesson from it to move forward and grow? You know, what are you what are you doing as you go as far is more important than how you end up at the end. The process is important. I think with the sage, the process is important. >> Yeah. The ends don't justify the means. The means are just as important. >> It's a life lived well. If you are looking to work with deity, how do you know if a deity, a god is calling to you? How would you know? How do you find a god to work with? Do you have any experiences with a deity reaching out to you? >> You know, I think it can be different for everyone. Sometimes it's just nothing turns into an obsession. You know, you're going about your day and living your life and then all of a sudden out of nowhere everything is Kaduin. You know, you're seeing cauldrons everywhere. You're seeing statues everywhere. You're seeing, you know, Keradin representation everywhere. You know, you feel like it's beating you in the face. It could be dreaming. You know, maybe maybe you're dreaming of a certain particular deity or aspect um frequently. I mean, it could come up in cards uh in in tarot. I mean there's there's a lot of ways you could find with me I found me personally I find that it's almost like that beating of the head you know everywhere you turn that's all you see I think there's three different ways and that what Shell's describing is one of the very common ways and that's where deity kind of chooses you where all of a sudden you start seeing ravens everywhere and eye patches and books and words and runes start popping up and you're like gee I wonder what all those symbols could mean. And so you look into it and you're like, "Oh, those are all associated with Odin." And then that feels right. So you start working with the deity that's reaching out to you that way. Frequency bias will happen when your brain, for whatever reason, whether it's because a deity is asking you to pay attention or you need something in your life, your brain is latching on to all these signs and symbols to give you a message. In this case, >> smack you in the head. >> That's right. Someone wants your attention. And so that is one way. The other way is your choice. You are interested in that deity, in that culture, in something about that pantheon. You just have an interest. And so you dedicate yourself or you do that research and that study. Perfectly valid. And we've talked about that in a previous episode um where back in in our old coven, we all did that. Each person took on a different deity that they were not accustomed to. when I talked about taking on Ple um and that experience and that that was a equally wonderful experience that I sought out. Ple did not seek me out. I sought her out and created that relationship over that period of time. You know, whatever works for you. They're they're both equally valid and wonderful. It's just so you getting hit in the head or you knocking on a door. >> That's right. >> That's exactly right. And the third way is you you touched on it a little bit, Shell. In our old coven, one of our ways of learning was each member would dedicate themselves for a year and a day to learning about a god and a goddess. And some people did that every year. Some people just did it a couple times. But that was one of our requirements is that you you took on that challenge. You took on that require not burden. What's another good word for burden? You took on that oath. You took on that um >> you took on that responsibility to expand your knowledge and understanding of different deities other than what maybe you initially chose or initially were comfortable with. It was a way to make us kind of expand deity knowledge >> and so that's a tradition requirement. Now ours was any deity. We didn't have a specific pantheon you had to work with but say right now Shell you are in a particular tradition. >> Correct. It's a Welsh traditional coven. So you are learning about Welsh deities. So that is a requirement. So those are typically the three ways is your tradition requires it. You are called by that deity or you choose a deity. And all of those are perfectly valid. >> Absolutely valid. >> And in any of those you may find a deity that you will work with for the rest of your life. Shell and Hakate. Don't talk about our relationship like that. >> That's right. Now, for me, the two gods in particular that called me and that I still work with are Canunos and Ganesa. >> I would have said Lilith for you. >> Lilith I worked with for a time, for a very long time, and she's still a very important part of my work, and I still have great respect for Lilith. But she was someone she was an entity I worked with mostly for a need and I think that was a mutual calling for that one. But she's not someone I I'm kind of glad I'm not still fully working with Lilith. >> Shh, don't say that to me. >> I know she's still on my altar. Don't get me wrong. She is still very prominently on my altar. I still definitely work with her, but I wouldn't say she's like a main deity any longer, which is fine. That happens, but Kunos and Ganesh have been there from the very very beginning. So, what are some ways that you have worked with a god? Like, how do you worship if you're you were going to approach a god or either a god that you work with or a god that you'd like to work with? How are some ways that you would worship a god? You know, I have always kind of seen the god and as a lot of folks do struggle a little bit with the god aspect. So I've really kind of focused on that ker nunos god and have kind of in my own way seen kunos as all three aspects. That's very easy to do. Even if you see him as the generic horned god, if you just say the horned god of witches, he's very accessible. We've said before, he's one of the first gods that people come to in witchcraft. He can be very all-encompassing and he can be all you need really. You know, you don't need any more than the horned god. He, like you just said, he encompasses all of the aspects. >> But I I have a certain view of Keranunos. And there was a a point in time where I kind of needed to work with like a more stern grandfatherly figure as opposed to the warm and caring grandfatherly figure. You know what I'm saying? And I decided that I needed to work with Odin because I needed a little more firmness than I felt that I would get from Karenos. So I went and I sought out a connection with Odin for that. But I do think that sometimes it is harder to connect with the God. That could be preconceived bias. I I I don't know what it is. So really, I only sometimes can think of the god in those two aspects because again, I was compelled to make a connection with Odin at one point. And I've always felt that Kerunos was that all-encompassing god in my in my view. I see him as those three aspects. >> Kunos was the very first god that ever showed up for me. I mean, I've always been a child of the woods. That's pretty much all I would do is disappear into the woods, be gone, and not come back out until the weekend was over. But being in the woods is my safe place, my happy place. And it's very easy to feel connected to the land and to the energies there. And so that's where I first encountered Ker Nunos in many of his forms because he's so easy to connect with as a forest spirit and forest energy. >> And you know, it's funny you say that because I was talking to my sweet darling love earlier this week. I felt like I had a carunos sighting. You know, we have listener in the wild sightings. We have shell sightings. We have had a caruno sighting this week. And and being from a woodsy area, you get this. you know, upstate New York, very deer populated, and we don't see a lot of deer out here on the coast of Massachusetts. At least in the time I've been here, we don't. And the other day, we were driving down the road in a relatively not super populated. It was country as far as Massachusetts thinks, right? Like, this isn't country, folks. But >> there's half a mile between each McMansion. >> No, they're they're still like 40 feet apart. but they call it country. So, um I won't name the town. So, we were driving in in the quote unquote country here and all of a sudden out of nowhere, like literally like 3 feet next to the road was a 10point buck. And like you don't see that around here. And like I swear, you know, you're driving by and you know how it is when like all of a sudden there's a deer there. You can't really slow down, but you're like, "Oh, shit." >> I feel like this deer and I literally made eye contact. Have you ever felt like that? >> That you literally make eye contact. I just I almost texted you too cuz I'm like I just feel like I had a Keranos sighting. Like I just felt like that was an embodiment of Ker Nunos and somehow I needed to see that. I would 100% say that that's exactly what happened. You know, when you have that deep of a feeling, especially when something's out of the ordinary like that and it strikes you, that's in my mind, that's a magical moment. And so now it's your job to figure out why >> why >> why did Karen Nunos make eye contact? What was the purpose? But you discerned that. That was sent to you. You could feel that in that moment. >> And it it literally was in that moment. It wasn't like something you ponder, you know? It's like you make eye contact and you're like, whoa. Like that hits your soul. That is Kunos on the side of the road I just drove by. Like it's like an instant. You know this. You feel it. It's not I just saw some random deer driving down the road. Like you said, it's striking to you. Yeah. Definitely feels different. Now, if you have a moment like that, if you have a god that's reaching out to you for one reason or another, especially if you don't know why. Shell knows that it's a reason. She doesn't yet know why. Maybe she's got some inklings that she's not sharing with us, but she knows there's a reason. >> Well, I also can say I'll just add this little tidbit. The last time I went back to New York about four or five weeks ago, the same damn thing happened in New York. I made eye contact with a deer. So, it's not the first time. It's just weird that it happened here, but it's happened twice now. >> Well, it happened there because as we both know, Shell, if you ignore the signs that you're given, they get bigger and bigger until you pay attention. That freaking buck followed me to Massachusetts. It did. If you have a sign like that, your job as a witch is now to research that. Why? Look for kunos. And just like when you're trying to interpret a dream, you need to kind of push and prod at your feelings. What was I feeling? What happened? What emotions went through me? What was my first thought? When I recreate the moment, what's the first connection that I make in my brain? Write these things down because they're very important. Interpreting signs, just like interpreting dreams, is extremely personal. Your own biases, thoughts, ideas, connections, are going to be very, very different than someone else's. So, people can give you a general idea of what archetypes mean. We can generally tell you that buck was probably kunos. >> But only you know your message. And you know, I bust your ass all the time about journaling. I really do. But you're not wrong. You know, these are things that you kind of because like you said, it's not something that you can go and find an an interpretation in a book. What does it mean when I see a 10point book in a weird location, you know, like that ain't coming up in a book? Like, these are things that you kind of have to I don't even want to say these words. >> Journal it out. Journal it out. You know, you do. You do because it's you're you're writing your own book. You're you're writing your own your own correspondence uh tables. You know, some things you can't get out of a book. And this is a perfect example. >> Yeah. This is the perfect book of shadows grimmooire moment. >> Exactly. >> Set up an altar. For me, I set mine up to Odin because he had said, "We're working together." So, >> oh, we are, are we? >> That's right. For Shell, it's Ker Nunos. Maybe she'll put antlers. Maybe she'll put representations of Kunos. Maybe it'll be something that represents a pathway or a forest. >> I actually do have a Ker Nuno statue. So, >> exactly. You know, for me, it was ravens. It was writing out the runes. It was more journaling. It was reading. But it was also I took a black cloth and made like a like a headband, like a strip of cloth, and I put it down over one eye, like I was covering one eye with a bandage when I would meditate for Odin. And I kept that strip of cloth on the altar that I had created while I was working with and researching Odin. >> Yeah, these are things you could do. Find representations. Find things that evoke the feeling of the deity you think is reaching out to you. And then work with it. Meditate with it. Look up their culture. Look up their mythology. What type of offerings do they like? What type of rituals and stories do they like? And then >> Oh my god. Funny story. My best friend Ila gave me deer antlers this summer. >> So weird. I wonder if that was a sign. >> Actually, now that I think about it, I'm like, "Wow, that kind of adds to the pile." >> Maybe it is a sign. >> I'm going to make a quick left turn, but it's related. I promise. I did give you deer antlers this summer. I've actually given out a couple different pairs of deer antlers because uh my father is a very prolific hunter. He loves his land and he does love to hunt, but he's always been very very respectful of nature. He is a very conscientious hunter and this is something that he I would say it's basically his life. He's it's very important to him and he doesn't really identify as a pagan or a Christian, but he does say that the land is sacred. >> Oh, he worships the land. I don't care what he says. I know >> he really does. every time he hunts deer or any animal, it's it's important to him to do it the right way and to do it respectfully. And he has been doing this his whole life and he's over 70 now. And he has kept quite a few of the antlers and things that he has hunted. And I just recently came into possession of a very large amount of them. And this type of energy, this type of God energy. This is my father from a young man to a father, middle-aged man to now as a grandfather, a sage. I have antlers from deer that he has hunted as the huntsman, the god of the wood his whole life. And he wrote on each of these antlers. You'll see if you look on the back of the antlers I gave you, there's a date, there's a year, and a name, and in some cases a place of where it was hunted. He knows the stories behind every single one of those pairs of antlers. So when I give someone antlers, these are imbued with the energy of the god. This is a person's life. His whole life living, walking the paths of the woods, as a huntsman, as a provider, as someone who tends to the life of the land. That's powerful. That's God energy right there. So, in each of these sets of antlers that I have been gifting to people, it's almost like I'm gifting Kerunos's, you know, the essence of the wood to people. And that's because we are gods. We are God. We are goddess. Our lives follow the same cycles of deity. And there's power in that. So, anyway, that's my side tangent is that I have all these wonderful, amazing antlers, but I think that they're they're very special to me. And I do love giving them to people because I do feel like I'm sharing a little piece of that magic of that forest magic with people, that God energy. >> I love that. I love that. And I love my antlers and I treasure them. I treasure them. >> You know, I I I I feel like I have to mention this just because of the deer sighting and the antlers. We did start working with in invoke Ellen of the Ways earlier this year. another antler deity and >> forest walking, path walking, liinal spaces deity. Yeah. >> You know, I think sometimes things these signs can come in pairs. You know, I I do think that Karen Nunos's calling and I think that sometimes because I do struggle a little bit with that God energy, maybe that's why we ended up doing that whole thing with Ellen of the Ways. Maybe I needed that horned goddess to kind of come to the forefront to be like, "Okay, you can it's okay to work with the horned god. You'll be fine, girl. You'll be fine." This is just me kind of talking through it, but sometimes you just got to talk through the signs and put the signs together. >> I think that's fantastic. I mean, you and I both kind of found Ellen of the Ways around the same time, and she's another kind of pieced together, re-imagined goddess, but she feels so right. She feels so perfect. And as someone who has worshiped and worked with Kunos for so long, Ellen of the Ways feels almost feels like coming home to me because Kunos, that horned god, is so important to me. I love seeing a horned goddess that has the same place, you know, because, you know, it's that balance. It's that, you know, I have a lot of god energy in me and so I like to see that reflected in my deity and I so I think she's fantastic. >> They're they are like natural consorts to each other. Totally reminds me of you and your husband. Just saying. >> A yeah, actually I see that too. So I think when you know circling back to to the sage god in in that that elder aspect of the god he is going to present himself to you in the manner in which he feels you need to see him and work with him in. But >> when working with that aspect of the god remember to take the stance of soak it all in take it all in. Learn what you can. This is this is that knowledge imparting grandpa that just wants to tell you every story from every adventure and experience they've ever had. And it is your duty to soak it all in and take that wisdom and impart it on your life. And I like how you said duty because it kind of is. I mean these are deities. However you look at the aspect, whether you look at them as individuals or you look at them of reflections of our self or aspects of a greater power, however you view them, it's still deity. And so approaching them with reverence and respect and with with that sense of duty and honor, I think is vital. So when you do work with them, if you are doing a ritual, do it with respect. do it with great respect. This would be the time, especially in the beginning. I mean, I know you and Hate at this point, me and Ken Nunos at this point, it's just like, hey, let's go. >> Let's do this. >> Let's do this thing. However, that's a relationship. You know, you don't start out with a relationship that way. You >> It wasn't like that in the beginning. I promise you. >> No. With me working with Odin, I approached humbly and with great respect. I cast circle. I came about it reverently. I created an altar. I made >> offerings, >> offerings, learning. We stress this every time someone asks. But that is the best way to show your devotion to a deity is to learn everything you can about them from firsthand sources. Go to their culture. Go to people who grew up in that religion. Go to where that deity is from and learn as much as you possibly can about them. That is the best way to get started worshiping any deity. And if you can't go um you know >> Well, I meant like go like mentally. I meant like get the books. I didn't mean like go to that place physically. >> Okay. >> Okay. I was going to say I haven't been to Greece. We have quite a We're pretty tight and I haven't been to Greece >> yet. I apologize. I worded that terribly. I just meant like get that information, right? >> Get that information. Learn it. Seek it out. Seek it out. Seek out that connection as well. Because as with anything, witchcraft or not, practice makes perfect, I guess, is the best way I can say it. You know, you you got to put the time in. You've got to you've got to put the learning in as well as the practice in like Leila said, you've got to create that deity altar. Set that that space aside where you are focused on worship, appreciation, you know, have out your offerings. Maybe you don't have antlers. You know, maybe it's kerunos and you don't have antlers. Get a picture of antlers if that's what you got to do. Rip it out of a magazine. Do whatever it takes, but create some little shrine, some little altar, an everyday acknowledge it. That's probably my best first step to give people. Acknowledgement. Frequent daily acknowledgement. It It gets you into that groove. It gets you into that building of connection and then it kind of spirals from there. Talking about the daily connection and pictures got me thinking about working with Ganesha because that's that's a common thing with Ganesha. Ganesha is the elephant-headed god in the uh he's a panhindu god and by that I mean he's in Hinduism but he's also in other cultures and religions as well and he's the remover of obstacles. He is the child of Shiva and Parvati and he represents resilience, wisdom, facing challenges. I would say he's somewhere like a father sage god because it's the intelligence there, >> right? >> But working with Ganesha, it's recommended that you have a representation of him, something that you can honor and and put sweets in front of, uh decorate with oils or vermilion powder, um put flowers on, but it doesn't have to be a statue. It can be a picture. Just like you said, if you get a picture out of a magazine, you draw a picture, you print out a picture, Ganesha is okay with that. He just wants you to have his beautiful image there and to honor it and to give offerings to it. And that's okay. Now, Hinduism, before anybody yells at me, Hinduism is not closed. Ganesha is not a closed practice in any way, shape or form. Ganesha is for everyone. So, don't worry about it if you do want to study Ganesh. But that's that's part of learning about deity, right? is finding these things out, learning this stuff. >> And that's not to say that you can't work with any deity that calls to you. Just make sure that you seek them out and seek their information out the right way. But working with Ganesha every day, there's prescribed rituals. You know, you come to him in a certain way. You come to him every day. You make offerings. You cover your head. You do a chant. And you pick a period of time where you do something like that for a god. It doesn't have to be to Ganesh where you do his his chant every single day at the same time or whatever. But pick something and make it a ritual and make it special. You could create your own ritual for deity if there isn't ones that you can find or you are unaware of one. Create your own daily or weekly ritual to deity. >> Right. Exactly. And then commit to it for 30 days, 40 days. You know, pick a time period to give to that deity, to offer to them as a as a sacrifice of your time, to honor them. That's a great way to learn and to give energy to them as an offering >> and to build connection. >> Oh, absolutely. And then before you know it, you'll be like, "Hey, he hop in the passenger seat. We got to do." You'll be right there going, "Let's go." >> Right. Right. >> But you got to start somewhere. >> All right. So, now that we've talked about the youth, the warrior, and the sage gods, coming up here in a couple weeks, we'll be returning to our seven-part series, and we'll be starting with the young goddess, >> the maiden. >> The maiden. That's right. But before we get there, we are going to have a special guest come on in the the next week. We hope you enjoy that. And then we'll be coming right back to this series. >> Now, Leila, we have a surprise. We do. It's true. Actually, we have two surprises. Two surprises. Why don't you tell them about the first one that's a repeat of something we did last year? So, you know how much I love love love to go find mail at the PO box. And we also know how much you love love love the Christmas season. I do love the Christmas season. How many trees are you going to have this year? >> Do we have to talk about this? Why are we shaming me for multiple trees? I just love ornaments. I love trees. I love ornaments. I love trees. I love ornaments. >> Yes. So, we love the season. We love mail. So, what are we doing, Jenn? >> All right, folks. It is it is approaching ule and we are going to bring back our ULE card exchange. So, >> if you weren't here with us last year or if you have forgotten cuz you smoked too much weed, this is the deal. >> Why you calling me out now? You know, hey, it is what it is. So, you send us a UL card, we will send you back a ULE card. And I had a lot of fun with this last year. And people sent us some beautiful, gorgeous, and sometimes bizarre ule cards. And I loved every >> damn one of them. >> We read every single letter. And how fun. So much fun. And this year we have designed our very own yoke cards. So you'll be getting a Leila and Shell designed card. >> You know, last year I actually kind of laughed because So Helen Jojo, we love you. She sent us >> she sent us the same card. We sent her back. We happened to get the same cards. It was hysterical, but I love minds. Great minds think. So this year this year we have designed our own card. And again, if you have forgotten, we are at Back on the Broomstick, PO Box 106, Salem, Massachusetts 01970. What's our second secret? What's our second secret? Due to popular demand, our second secret is, drum roll, please. We've opened an Etsy shop. No No  We have Back on the Broomstick merch. Right now, we've got t-shirts, sweatshirts, bags, and even ule ornaments. And I think there might be a journal or two. >> You know, it's cuz I love ornaments more than anything. And of course, there's a journal. How could there not be a journal? It would only make sense for there to be a damn journal. >> That's right. Now, all of this was designed by us.

It's amazing. >> It's gorgeous. >> So, go check it out. >> Ila's going to post links and there'll be links on our website, but, you know, just give us some feedback. Let us know. And I think most importantly, let us know what you would like. What kind of merch would you like? Tell us, email us, send us a DM. >> We love to hear it. So hopefully you guys can stop over there and get yourself a cool sweatshirt or bag or journal for when you're working with the god. >> No, they want ornaments. They don't want journals. >> Well, maybe they want both. I don't know. But we're very much looking forward to seeing all of your wonderful ule cards this year. and also looking forward to licking a lot of stamps. So, send them on in and we'll send you one back. So, while you're getting your cards and getting ready to run out to the mailbox for us, stay tuned for next week. And be wise, be wicked, >> and keep it witchy. [Music] The

----------------------------------------
Welcome to Back on the Broomstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimmooire, where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots after a long period of mundanity. >> We're rewalking the path of the wise, and trying out all the latest spells, [music] rituals, and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices. >> So, grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron, and [music] your crystals, >> and join us as we get back on the broomstick. Hi, and welcome to Back on the Broomstick. I'm this is part two of our seven-part deity series. Our topic for this episode is the second face of the god, the father, the warrior, the oak king in all his summer strength. This is the god who walks the paths of sacred spaces, the lover who tends the land with fierce devotion, and the wild-hearted father who nurtures and defends. He is the horned god in full maturity. and ready to talk about all things horny gods. I'm Shell. >> When you think father god, you think horned gods. Horny gods literally and figuratively. >> Exactly. And I know that we like to to not to jump right in, but I know we like to kind of think of this face, not just you and I, but maybe people in general as the green man or kerunos. But I forgot about Pan. And and and Pan is really kind of in this sphere as well. >> Like we talked about last episode when we were talking about the youthful god. We talked about Pan and Carnunos in that aspect as well because like us, like goddess, like gods, we don't all neatly fit into one box. We're not all just a youthful god. >> We're multiaceted folk. >> That's right. Don't pin us down. And you certainly can't pin a horny god down because they are nothing if not multifaceted. >> You might be able to strap them down though. >> Oh, they'd like that. >> Yeah. So, yeah, Pan, you know, I like that you brought up Pan and Kerunos because to me, they are two amazing, wonderful sides of the horned god, of the father god. Kunos is that stagghorned lord that walks the forest path. He's more the protector god. He's the wise lover. He's the wise one that will lead you through the paths because he knows the way. And Pan is more that impetuous, that lustful, youthful, playful. You know, you're kind of touching on exactly how I I wanted to explain it, too. Kind of the I look at Pan as almost that bridge between youth and adult, and then Keranos is almost that bridge between adult and sage. Does that make sense? >> It does. It does. And you know, this episode we're going to do that a lot, I think, because especially this aspect of the god, the father god, the warrior god. They're all kind of that god. Like every single one of them has that aspect, I guess, in some way. >> But they're also that nurturer, that lover, that that fertility bringer. >> But I'm also saying they're also the youth and the sage. You know, they're all of the things. Yeah. They're all the part. And so, and that's the first god that most people get introduced to when you think of witchcraft. When you think of the father of of all witcheries, it's Kunos, the horned god. It is the horned god of the witches. That's the one that we think of. And and I I hate to say it, but Jason Mankey hit the horned god right on the antlers, I guess, with that one because the title of of Jason Mankeyy's book is The Horned God of the Witches. And and it's an excellent book, and he does a very good job of talking about the god of the witches. He does not talk about the aspects explicitly that we're talking about here today. Again, this isn't going to be everybody's concept, but that's the god that you're first introduced to. That's the one that you see when you walk into witchcraft, I guess. >> And the same goes for for visually, too. Say you go to the old Google and you know you look up pagan gods. One of the first ones visually you're going to see is is Karenos either in one of two poses that that sexy half- naked antler you know holding the torque holding the serpent you know with his hooved feet or you're going to see that that more I call it rustic and rustic is not the word but it's kind of that old-fashioned older looking carunos you know legs crossed hands crossed the big huge straight up horn turns. Those are generally those two visuals you see. >> Yeah. And and I think that perfectly encapsulates Kerunos because he's um a stitched together god. He doesn't really have a lot of mythos. He doesn't have a lot of folklore behind him. He's >> because I do feel I do feel that this is maybe a couple of different stories wrapped into one person. >> Absolutely. >> Absolutely. Yes. >> Yes. And so he's one of those gods that is very he's modern in some ways like that that modern sexy great horned lord of the wood and then he's the ancient older kerunos that we don't know a lot about the mysterious cross-legged lion drawing that you're talking about >> leafaced >> yeah the faces >> leafaced >> that you'll see oh I love that you brought that up. So that's another thing. The the green man that the face of the green man that you'll see in all these different places is a face that represents nature and represents the growing things and the growing season which is also something very much that the god represents that cycle of growth and of maturation and and nurturing but also regeneration and rebirth. A lot of the artwork that I have of the green man, it's almost like his inner face is like a lighter green of new growth. And as the leaves go out to the sides of his face, it's almost like they're darker greens like wisdom, wear and tear, you know what I mean? >> Yeah. So, in that aspect, that grain man face is the triple god. You know, he is that regeneration, which is the youth. He's the maturation and growth. That's the father god. And then he's the, like you said, the battered, the wisdom of the sage god. So it shows all the different aspects in the one phase. It's such a pervasive symbol. Pretty sure in the UK you can find it in all sorts of historic places, including one of >> Oh my god. Oh my god. >> What? >> So now I know we have some UK listeners. Hi mates. So the king Charles himself, Chucky Boy. I affectionately call him Chucky Boy. So Chucky boyowed. >> Um I actually I have a friend who lives in England. >> Oh, so that means you're allowed to call the king Chucky. >> Very good friend of mine and him and I have agreed that I'm okay to call him Chucky Boy. >> All right. Fair. Fair. >> I used to call the Queen Lizzy with my friend. So it's okay. >> So Chucky boy, he has his coronation. He put the green man on his coronation invites. For those of you who don't know, >> and if we do have any listeners in England who have a invite from the coronation, please post a picture. He used the green man in this. Now, I think, and you know, I'm just going off what I read. I I'm not him. I don't know what his his internal dialogue was, but the green man symbolizes, you know, spring rebirth. He thought that it would be a good symbol for a new rain. And as a lot of people may or may not know, Charles is very much an environmental >> environmentalist. Yeah. >> He's very much into flowers, plants, uh, trees. So they thought that it was also relevant to his lifelong dedication to environmentalism in the natural world. I was blown away because, you know, you think of things like the monarchy, you know, they're a part of the Church of England, um, very Christian, and it almost felt like, hey, they haven't forgotten us. >> These are very old symbols. You'll see them everywhere. And I'm not surprised that an environmentalist would use that as a symbol because the green man, the father god, is very much all about the growing things and he is strongest when the growing season is at its height. So, it makes total sense. >> But they do actually have um the green man in I don't know what they're called, but you know how they would put like those plaster things on old buildings, especially um in England, gargoyles and what have you. There are actually a lot of green men um on churches and such. >> There are including my favorite Roslin Chapel which has a lot of green men in it and is quite the mystery because it even has ears of corn in it in the decorations and they hadn't discovered America yet when that chapel was built. >> Well, that's interesting. I didn't know that. [laughter] Yes. >> The thing I thought was interesting is that I've read in certain places that they did that to kind of bridge the gap between paganism and Christianity. >> Yeah. Yeah. That's a nice way of saying they did that so that they could sucker all the pagans into following [laughter] them. But yeah, I'm not a historian, but yeah. So, they did a lot of things like that, including changing dates of holidays and co-opting symbols. So, that's a different podcast though. different podcast, different podcast. But I would like to say that if we do have any listeners over in that region, if you do have pictures or could get pictures, I would totally be interested in seeing them, please post them. >> Absolutely. Yeah. And if you got pictures of Rosland Chapel, I love that [ __ ] So, the Green Man symbology is popular with environmentalists and witches. But when a lot of witches talk about the god, if they talk about the god, we're talking about this masculine energy that we all wear sometimes, you know, this this idea of the cycle of our life. And so seeing the god in these different forms is supposed to mirror us as well as the cycle of the seasons. But, you know, like you said, I think that for whatever reason people have, they're kind of quick to dismiss any relation with a god aspect. And I've always felt that Ker Nunos was kind of a good segue for people that are a little anxietyridden written about working with God energy maybe based on past experiences with past religions cuz Keranos I feel gives you that I am going to wrap you up and and hug you to death and teach you all you need to know and boot your ass out the door when you're ready. Yes, but Kunos is also scary to people because he's also highly sexual. He's very wild. He's the wild man running through the woods. He's the lover. He's the fierce lover. And sometimes that type of sexuality can be very scary to people. And he's also very horny. He's got a lot of horns. If you're coming from Christianity, that says devil. That says Satan. they automatically see goat feet and horns and assume Satan because that's how it's been painted for hundreds of years. You know, if they want to show someone as being evil or leerous, they throw horns on them. They make them look like a quote unquote demon or devil and that always involves horns. So sometimes I think kerunos can be scary to people, >> especially uh Pan. I think that is is very much a thing with Pan as well because Pan I think visually is much closer to the Christian devil than than maybe Ker Nunos. Yeah. And I think you're right. I think Kunos has more of that caring. I'm going to wrap you up in my arms and ask for consent every step of the way. Whereas Pan's a little more crass and wild about it, I guess. So, >> little more little more BDSM. >> Yeah. [laughter] There you go. Actually, I love that you said that about Ker Nunos, too, because he is that kind and and wonderful aspect of being a lover and and it reminds me of a quote from the spiral dance that I wanted to mention too. Uh Starhawk in the spiral dance does talk about the aspect of the god very reverently, slightly in subservience to the goddess. She's not quite hip to the whole equality thing exactly, but she does very much feel that the god is a vital part of any type of witchcraft religion because you need that balance, right? And I think that the pagan idea of manhood and masculinity is different than people that come from an Abrahamic religion background idea of masculinity. >> Absolutely. >> And I love her quote about it. what she said. Starhawk says, quote, "If a man had been created in the horned god's image, he would be free to be wild without being cruel, angry without being violent, sexual without being coercive, spiritual without being unsexed, and truly able to love." And I think that that is beautiful and that that really does sum up one version of what I think is positive pagan masculinity. I I know that there are bad people in all different groups and everything, but positive aspects of the father god, positive aspects of sexuality, you know, positive role models for people who identify as men, all of this are aspects of the green men. It's very important to have masculinity that complements femininity. You can't have regenerative life without both those aspects. If you're looking at it from purely a creation standpoint, nature requires these things. In nature, you have to have male and female to create life in order for things to keep moving forward, in order for the cycle to continue. You know, there's this balance, this beautiful blending and creation. And those are energies that we can embody. It doesn't have to be literal, but we can embody the idea of creation, of having these masculine and feminine energies within us and within the cycles of our life. And it's a joy and a beautiful celebration when you come to Kunos that way. But I do want to point out that you can work with Karen Nunos and you can work with that energy without it necessarily having to be in any sort of sexual context because that is scary to people and I don't want people to be like okay well I can never work with Karen Ununos because you know I'm not that's that's not my thing and I with everything deity included you know you just got to set boundaries >> and the aspect of the oak king of Kuno of growing things and even of sexuality. That just means celebration of life, celebration of creation. That just means joyous, spontaneous becoming. It doesn't necessarily have to be sex. It can be creating something new. It can be you've started something as the youth. Now you're seeing it through. You're following it through. You're doing the thing that needs to be done, right? And you're doing it with joy and with work and with energy. And that's also part of that father God kunos high noon sun god energy. It's not all all just sex but creation of life creation and followth through is part of that. I have to do this. I have to make a left turn story here because this is hysterical and relevant and the listeners need to hear this as as well as you. So at my wonderful part-time job that I love so much, we sell crystal figures. There are little figurines of penises. I'm not going to lie. So, at one point, we had them up at the front register. And you know how when you go to a lot of metaphysical shops, they have those like little mesh bags. >> So, we have each one in in in a little bag for people at the front register. And people like, "Oh, what's this?" Cuz you couldn't really see it. It's a bag of dicks. You need a bag of dicks. Everybody needs a bag of dicks. That was the thing. [laughter] >> And they're pretty dicks. >> They are pretty dicks. >> Pretty crystal dicks. Yeah, >> they really are made from multiple different style crystals. >> Variety of dicks is always good. >> Actually, now we sell big ones, too. Not even going there. Different conversation. So, back to bag of dicks. You know, we had a couple customers be like, "Oh, you know, I don't need any kind of fertility in my life. I've had my kids." Okay, I get you. I've had my kids. I'm good. Fertility doesn't always mean babies. And we used to tell people because now we've sold out of our bags of dicks. They are all sold out. Everybody got their bags of dicks. >> I I kind of want a bag of dicks. I'm sad I don't have them. >> I'm going to have to ask my boss if we can order more dicks. >> If there's any like spare dicks behind the counter, see if there's any dicks in the back that they can bag up for us. Maybe there's some dicks hidden in a quarter of a box or something. [laughter] >> Well, we have big dicks now, which I wasn't going to mention, but now we have like life-size. Anywh who, >> so then we started telling people that you can put these little dicks in your wallet and fertility can mean a fertile wallet. >> You know, you can put it in your garden. It could be a fertile garden. Just cuz you buy a little bag of dicks doesn't mean babies and and that kind of >> doesn't have to be babies or sex, >> right? It doesn't have to be sexreated. It could be you're putting your little dick in your wallet because you need money. I like to have a little crystal dick when I need to stand up firm for what I believe in. [laughter] >> I just love this because I know my boss is listening [laughter] and he's cracking his ass up right now and I really hope he's ordering more little dicks. >> I need a little bag of dicks, Tim. I'm telling you right now, I need them. I I do. But yeah, no, this is action energy. A little bag of dicks is a bag of action. You've got a you've got a bag of get up and go. [laughter] >> But see, it's a relevant analogy. It's a relevant analogy. >> Just like in our in our series about magic, what metaphors can you make with a bag of dicks? What type of energy does that masculine get up and go, that direct action energy? And I really liked when our old community did get together for Beltain a couple years ago, instead of having the men's and women's mysteries like we used to, they changed the names. And I can't remember off hand exactly what it was, but it was something more akin to active and receptive energies. And it did pretty much still break along gender lines, but this was the first year cuz I've kind of felt called to go to the men's mysteries before. And I would have been welcome no matter what it was called in our old community. You can go. Absolutely. >> Yeah. Whatever energy you were walking in, go to that mystery, but I just never did until they changed the name and I went and I very much enjoyed participating in that mystery that particular year, but it was named something different. It was more like uh direct action or something along those lines. But that's really what that what that energy of that dick is, that masculine energy. It doesn't have to. >> You just grabbed that bag of dicks and threw them over your shoulder and off you went. Off I went with an axe in my hand to chop down a tree with all the other people with the bags of dicks in their hands, too. Cuz we all had that direct action energy, right? But yeah, I mean, it doesn't have to be, you know, babies and sex. This type of energy is is creation. It's being a father. It's following through. It's teaching. It's modeling behavior. It's >> mentoring. >> Exactly. All of that. And if you need to have a little crystal dick in your wallet to remind you to be that standup kind of person who takes action and is a good mentor, then get yourself the prettiest little crystal dick you could find and carry it in a bag. >> Tim, we need more crystal dicks. >> We do. We [laughter] do. But you know, that's that is the lesson of this God is that yeah, sometimes he does look scary. Sometimes he's big and intimidating, but that can be you, too. He's in all of us. And sometimes you need to be big and scary and intimidating. And sometimes you need to be that nurturing father and that person who has the get up and go and the fire under their ass or or who does stand up, rise and stand up for what they want, you know. [laughter] >> Yeah, we can keep going with this all night, people. >> We really could. We [laughter] really could. >> You know, I did have a question, Michelle. >> Okay. A few listeners did mention that they liked the idea of this particular series that we're going to be doing about the god and the goddess. However, they have a little bit of a bone to pick with the aspect of the oak king and the holly king. >> Talk to me. Talk to me, Leila. >> Well, we've had this question before and I think our answer is going to kind of be similar here, but people are saying that neither oaks nor holl in their part of the United States. >> So, what? Yeah, that's what I said, too. But yeah, it it can be kind of hard when all the major things are talking about concepts and plants and ideas and and even weather patterns that are from the northeastern Yeah. They're from the northeastern United States or Western Europe particularly. So, they don't exactly match. >> Okay. Now, we have kind of talked about this, I think, previously in many, many, many different episodes, but I think it comes down to what I like to call magic of place. Maybe you have palm trees and coconut trees. Okay, then call it the the the palm and the coconut king, you know, like whatever works for you in in your environment. Let's say I lived in Hawaii. It's my dream. I just want to be in 72 degrees all year round. palm trees and coconut trees is a good analogy because they are, you know, you're not getting oak trees and and holly trees out in Hawaii. Visually, use what you got. If you have to use a coconut tree and a palm tree in lie of the oak and in holly, then that's what you do to visualize that in your head. Call them by native plants in your area. Whatever's at its height of of growth in the summer would be the summer god would be the young god. And whatever is at its height of growth or power in around sin and ule would be the dark half of the year god, the holly king, the sage god. >> Maybe it's the Joshua tree and the cactus. I don't know. >> That's right. And that's really the point is that no matter where you live, the solstesses and the equinoxes are going to happen wherever you happen to be. So this changing of seasons happens even if it doesn't look just like it does here. That's not the point. The point is that the change is happening. Magic of place local. What does it look like where you live? What does that type of active god energy that growing changing season energy that yearong cycle? What does that look like where you live? We're witches. This is what we do. You learn your whole life. You will never be done learning. >> Oh my god. Another funny left turn story. Totally relevant. >> So, we did um I I was at my my coven sin gathering. Love you guys. >> I love you. >> In our tradition, in in the Welsh tradition, there's this thing with nine woods. Okay. I am not in Great Britain and I don't have access to each of those individual nine different woods, nor does my high priestess. So here in Salem, Massachusetts, there is a location that is probably the best pinpoint of where people were actually killed as witches. That whole proctor's Proctor's Ledge that we went to, >> that is not an actual ledge, Josh. [laughter] >> And so what she did for her nine woods is she went and collected nine different sticks from that particular location. Are these the traditional nine woods from Wales? No. Does it suffice? Abso freakingutely. >> I remember when the great Billy Bardau >> Oh, Billy did a beltine fire. Believe it was a beltine fire. Might have been a sin fire. Not sure. One of the two. >> It was a fire. >> It was a fire for a ritual. But he also did the nine sacred woods. And the way he did it was he knew some crafts people that had access and used some of the different woods in their crafts. So they had those. And I think at least two pieces of wood came from furniture. One had been refurbished and it was leftover pieces of oak or something. I don't remember. And I don't remember what the second wood was, but it was a piece that was beyond repair, but it was a particular type of wood that was needed for the nine sacred woods. So needs must, man. You got to do what you got to do. >> Got to do what you got to do. >> Exactly. And the important thing is your high priestess picked nine sticks from a local very sacred place. That's nine sacred woods right there. >> Exactly. Exactly. >> And that's nine woods that are sacred to you and your land and the place where you guys are walking right now. >> Correct. >> The solstice is happening. This year-long cycle season, the wheel of the year is really the wheel of the god. And so that cycle is going to happen no matter where you live. So write about it, follow it. You know, I got to say journal. Drink people. If you're doing the Reddit game, I've said journaling. So have a drink. >> Damn journals. >> I know. Apparently there's a drinking game based on it. [laughter] >> But anyway, >> enjoying that. So the oak king that we're talking about today is really the mature aspect of the god. The green man carunos that you know the sexy mature daddy guy. You know he's the big shouldered walk you home through the woods kind. >> Exactly. And he rules on the light half of the year. And there's a lot of confusion about that one too. >> Oh lord. It's light when it's dark. It's dark when it's light. Just kill me now. So the oak king rules the light half of the year which is from Ule until Litha. >> Yeah. Which is pretty dark when he starts. >> Yeah. And then the Holly King starts his rule when it's very bright. It seems bright. But the dark half of the year starts right after the solstice. It does. Right. The longest day. Then the night starts to get stronger and that's when the dark half of the year starts. So, it's a little confusing for people. And I I don't think of it so much as like they replace each other. I think of it as parts of the year they walk hand in hand >> like a passing the torch kind of thing >> almost, but walking together before they pass the torch. Like, you know, we had the fight back in the day where we had the two of them fight for the hand of the goddess and one fight. Yep. >> Yeah. And one replaced the other. I think they walked side by side during that transition. >> Yep. >> So, Ule is coming up and that's when the young god is born. That's when the the oak king is born. I don't think that the holly king, the sage god goes away. I think at ule he is walking hand in hand with the oak king. >> Correct. >> So after the winter solstice, after Ule, it's technically the light half of the year. And the young god, the oak king, reigns supreme on the light half. Even though it still seems dark and cold and not a lot is growing, it's still the light half of the year. And because it's still dark and cold, the Holly King is still in power. Death still walks the land. December and January, February are still the depths of winter. So they're together. The young growing oak king and the strong, powerful sage god. Right? So the oak king as youth is learning and growing stronger just as the sun in the sky is growing stronger and the days are getting longer. The Oak King grows up. He's a young child at Imbulk, a young man at Oara, and then is fully in his power, a mature man at Beltine. And now he's walking alone. After Oara, the Holly King's really no longer there. It's just the Oak King walking in full power through Beltaine up to Litha. >> At Beltaine, he walks on his own from there. >> Then at Litha, the Oak King is joined by the Holly King. But now it's the young god who is technically the strong one even as his power is waning like the sun and the holly king is growing in power. Then the wheel turns and we've got Lunasa and Maven and the young god is cut down and sacrificed and finally laid to rest at sin. And so the holly king walks alone from sin until o king is reborn at ule. And that's always blown my mind because I always think of the Holly King as like a Ule thing and like it's just it it just is confusing to me. >> It is. It's so >> 30 years later, I still don't understand it. >> Yeah, it's hard cuz they're together sometimes waxing and waning through the whole year. And you could see them as one kind of dude growing and you know changing throughout his life. It's just one person. He's just himself. >> Similar to the triple goddess and how technically it's one. See how works. See how that all works? >> It all comes right back around. We can weave it all right back in. And so bringing that into your life again, the father god, that masculine energy, that nurturing strength. Not all of us had great dads. Some of us do, some don't. Some of us have great stepdads, some of us don't. Whatever father type figure you have in your life or whatever father figure you wish you had in your life or you wish you could be, you know, be that father figure yourself, think about that. that nurturing energy that that's a wonderful way to connect with that. >> You got you got to switch topics or I'm going to go into a Taylor Swift nose dive. New album song, Father Figure. Move on. >> The father figure I know was by >> George Michael. >> Yes. >> Yeah. >> All right. So, father gods remind us masculinity can be sacred without being overdominant and dickish. The body is sacred and desires not sin. It can be spellcraft. Desire and sexuality and growing and all these things are sacred and part of life and we need to be more connected to that. And I love that you brought up local and being local to find how these seasons relate to your life because that's another excellent way to connect with the green man with Kunos with that father figure of the god. And maybe people in different traditions may have a different name for this aspect of the god and not kerunos or pan. Whatever mythos, whatever tradition you follow, whatever that that father figure, that kind of warrior aspect that works for you, the name is irrelevant. It doesn't have to be keruna pan. It could be whatever you follow. It could be Shiva. It could be Anon. It could be the Dagda. It could be all all these different father gods, you know, whatever tradition that you're from. I don't know all the father gods in all the different traditions, but they're out there and they all have that aspect of encouraging you, teaching you, trying to walk with you. Yeah. Protecting you. If you need protection, these are the gods to call. If you ever had to call your dad to come and get you, you know, my dad's bigger than your dad, that kind of thing. My kun nose is bigger than your kun nose. >> Yeah, you need a little protection. That's who you're going to be calling in. And you can embody that energy. You can walk in that masculine energy yourself and bring that go get them attitude, that fearlessness, that protectiveness, that nurturing, that sexuality, that growth, whatever that is, whatever that father god, warrior god energy is for you. If you need that, call on one of those father gods. >> Bring your bag of dicks, folks. Bring your bag of dicks. >> There you go. And on that note, order us some dicks, Tim. [laughter] >> I'm going to go to work and he's going to be like, "What the hell?" Everybody's going to be like, "We need these dicks. Where's the dicks?" [laughter] >> Right. Work with the father god. Especially this time of year. Work with the holly king. You know, he's a little scary around sin. The oak king has been sacrificed and, you know, he he's kind of gone right now. It's a little weird that we're talking about the father god in the season where he's not really here right now. [laughter] >> Yeah. I mean, it it's it's it's definitely past his time, but it's almost like we just had that like crossover where he was kind of fading out. They were in that hand in hand and now he's fading. You know, the holly king in his aspect of Santa Claus, the holly jolly old guy with the white beard. He's also seen as a father. Father Christmas. He's sometimes called Father Christmas. He's a provider. So, he's both those things. He's the father and the sage. You know, some more of a sliding scale. These older sage gods, these wise wisdom gods can also be very nurturing, especially on a cold winter night. They can help you through this dark season. They're crafty. They have stories. And so they're kind of in that in between father and sage kind of being kind of energy. And it's hard for me to talk about the triple aspects of the god because they're so wrapped up in in being just the god >> in one. The god. >> The god. And you can really see so much of all of them. It's just hard. It's hard to kind of separate them. But but you >> I do feel I do feel the distinction is a little bit easier with the goddess. I don't know if it's because being a female and living kind of that maiden mother crone aspects of life, but I I do kind of I kind of equate the same thing to the god. You got the young, you know, late teens, early 20s, then you go to the middle-aged, and then you go to the wise old crone man version. you you know it's it kind of almost just follows those phases of life just as like I think of the goddess phases is almost following the phases of life >> and it really does but I guess for me I'm going to borrow one of your phrases maybe I'm weird but [laughter] [gasps] >> we already know this is true but when I was a kid I felt so old I was one of those people that they said oh you're so >> you're such an old soul you're an old soul and you know now that I am physically older I'm older than you and you say you're old as dirt all the time. But I don't feel old. I feel very >> The old The [laughter] older we get, the younger we get, >> right? I guess >> it's like a Gen X curse. >> There you go. That's maybe that's what it is. I don't know. But it's just easy to see the blend. And it's just more proof that people like the gods are rarely just on one part of that wheel of the year. We are young and wise, old and ready to start new things. We can be more than one thing at a time. and so can the gods. And I love that. I think when I'm doing spell work, I do call them out for specific characteristics. If I'm working with a deity or asking petitioning a deity for something, asking for their help in a working, I do call upon them in a specific way with specific characteristics that would fit into like a youthful or a mature or a sage type aspect. >> To kind of almost back you up, I do kind of and I don't know why it's with some deities and not with others. It's weird with me. I am a weirdo. But with certain deities, it's almost like I'll use Hate for an example because it's easy for me. And and you know this about me. I have seen Hkate as that young I've I've seen Hate as kind of that my age, middleage, and I've seen Hikate as the old crone. And I see Kerunos sometimes the same way. I can see Keranunos in every different aspect. But you know, somebody like Odin, I'm not looking at Odin as a [ __ ] youthful god. Oh my god, he'd poop my ass, you know. >> But you could see him as the father and the >> Yeah. Right. >> But you're right. I would never see him as the youth. >> But do you see that how there's some deities you can see all three aspects in, but then there's certain deities that you only see in like one, maybe two. >> Yes. Yes. Like say Oara. I don't think I would see her as the crone, >> right? That'd be a hard visualization. >> That would be very hard. So, I don't see them all with all three aspects as much as say Kerunos easily. I can see all three there. Or I know that Hkate is not a triple goddess so much so that she is a triumvirate, right? >> She's not the maiden, mother, crone in one, but she can be the maiden. She can be the mother, she can be the crone just like Kerunos. So yeah, not all not all deities can I see all >> but for some it does it does work with and I think it works with >> kunos. Yeah, the green man pan kerunos. It's very easy to see a lot of those. A lot of the Welsh deities I think they can kind of span a lot of >> the spectrum of the >> Yeah. The Celtic, the Welsh, they they really do kind of they're young, they're old. Depending on the story, they're changing their ages. So yeah. Okay. Yeah, that fits. >> Maybe 20 this week. >> There you [laughter] go. That's pretty much what they did in those myths. They're like, "Hey, I want to be young and beautiful today." And so >> X2, >> "Hey, Loki did it, too." And Loki from more of the Norse pantheon, Loki can be any age and he can be any gender. And so that's something to consider as well. Gods can be all these different things. So when you're working with the father aspect, I guess it's just like anything you want to define your intention, right? Why are you working with this deity in this particular aspect? What types of father warrior qualities are you looking for? And then you would decide this is the deity that matches and these are the aspects that I'll be working with. >> Yeah. >> No, I think we've green man and carunased them to death. So, next week we're going to talk about the sage. >> Thank you so much for listening to this episode of Back on the Broomstick. We really appreciate you guys and my goodness, thank you for continuing to send us the cards, the letters, the gifts in our PO box. It has been a lot of fun and we really appreciate it. We're going to be doing a solarium with some book reviews and a mailbox review again. Now, just as a reminder, back on the broomstick, PO Box 106, Salem, Massachusetts 01970. We love mail. I love getting it. I love opening it, texting Ila the pictures of it and us squealing like we're four-year-olds on Christmas morning, Ule morning, birthday morning. >> Yeah, it's like it's our birthday every day when Shell goes and opens the mailbox. It's fantastic. We appreciate all that. And we're also very happy that Federica, our wonderful wizard of winner of our season of the witch giveaway, got her lovely gift despite all the gremlins in the US Postal Service. And she sent us pictures. Oh, maybe she can get pictures of the green men over there. >> Maybe. Fingers crossed. That would [music] be very cool. So, thank you all so much for sending in all the different spooky places. We have quite the [music] list now. I'm very much trying to get Shell to go to as many of them as we possibly can next week. >> We totally need an RV. Totally. We >> really do. One of these days we will definitely [music] have one. Next week we will be coming back with the third installment of our God series on the sage. >> And if you're interested in a bag of dicks, send us a message and I'll see if I can hook you up. >> On that note, [music] be wise, be wicked, >> damn it, keep it witchy.

----------------------------------------
Welcome to Back on the Broomstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimmooire, where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots after a long period of mundanity. >> We're rewalking the path of the wise, and trying out all the latest spells, rituals, and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices. >> So, grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron, and your crystals, >> and join us as we get back on the broomstick. Hi and welcome to Back on the Broomstick. I'm L I and Shell and I are starting a seven-part series on deities. We'll be discussing the concept of the triple god and the triple goddess, often called the youth warrior sage and maiden mother crone. And for this episode, we'll be starting out with the youth, the young god. I'm Shell and I want to point out that people might be befuddled at the moment and they might say, "Well, Leila said seven and only mentioned six." Well, we are also going to add in the fourth face of the goddess. >> Sometimes called the hidden face or the dark face of the goddess. >> And that's how we come up with seven. So, strap in because we are starting with the god. Why? Because everybody starts with the goddess. So, we're starting with the god. A lot of folks, I think, may not be as familiar with the triple aspects of the god. And I think that's why we thought that this would be an important concept for us to explore because we often times think of the god and the triple goddess. And I do think that sometimes the the triple aspects of the god do get forgotten or fall by the wayside. Part of that is because the triple aspect of the god is much newer. It's a much newer concept than the triple aspect of the goddess. The triple aspect of the goddess follows the moon phases, right? The waxing, the full, and the waning moons. And then of course there's the fourth phase, the dark moon or the new moon face of the goddess. And so that's talked about a lot. And if you go back to like Robert Graves and his book, The White goddess, he talks about a triple goddess. And that's 1948. So that's pretty old. But most of the time they would talk about the dual aspect of the god and you you touched that on that a little bit shell the oak king and the holly king and these are particularly wiccan concepts these very much came from wikah >> true but I sometimes look at the triple aspect you know of the god you had said we've looked at the triple aspects of the goddess as far as the moon reference >> similarly I have looked at the same thing with the god as the rising sun, the high sun, and the setting sun. >> The triple god thing. This is one of the things I looked up because if you look online, you can't find anything prior to 2011 of people talking about the triple god. >> Not really. Yeah. >> No. So, you have to really kind of dig into your library. And the first places you're going to see the triple god mentioned is actually two books. And they both came out in 1989. And they are the witch's god by Janet and Stuart Ferrar. >> Love it. >> And they explicitly state the youth warrior and sage aspects of the god and also wikah the old religion in the new age by Vivian Crowley and those came out in the same year. And those are the first times where the triple aspect of the god is explicitly stated. >> Okay, I got to make a left turn here cuz I just thought of something hysterical. >> What's that? So, you know the whole weird thing that we had with the whole 10,000 goddesses book and there was no such thing and we remembered it as that. >> Yeah. >> Same thing with the with this Janet and Stewart for our book, The Witches God. If you would have asked me what that book was called, I would have told you 10,000 gods because I thought it was 10,000 goddesses and 10,000 gods and apparently it's not. >> Nope. >> But this would have been the partner to that book that doesn't exist. But the idea of goddess and God in triplicate is very important to Wikah and to a lot of different types of witchcraft. And even if you don't adhere to Wiccan beliefs, the concepts are valid. The concepts of growth and change and seasons of your life is really what they're talking about. So you have the goddess maiden mother crone. And again, particularly in Celtic folklore, which is where a lot of original Wiccan ideas about the god, the horned god, Kerunos, came from, they have the god of the seasons, right? They have two seasons, the light half of the year and the dark half of the year, the growing season and the dying season. >> Kind of where we when we had the oak king and holly king story. >> Exactly. Exactly. But even they talk about the baby, the god being born and the young god as a child. So they don't explicitly state it, but >> in his rising sun phase. >> That's right. He's still kind of mentioned in there, but it wasn't really formalized until Vivian Crowley and Janet and Steuart Ferrar talking about this idea of the triple god. I love that because it does mirror the goddess and you do have to have that balance in energies. And I do agree with everything you you've said, but I do feel that if you do look back in in some of the literature that you can find, those triple aspects of the god were acknowledged. >> They're there. Yeah. >> They just weren't labeled as such. Whereas with the goddess, they were labeled that way. If you go back to like say the spiral dance and that came out in 1979 early early and Starhawk who wrote the spiral dance does talk about aspects of the god and she does talk about him mirroring the triple goddess. She doesn't explicitly say it, but it is implied. And the seasons of the god and the seasons of life are talked about. And again, they like to emphasize the two sides of the god, but they do still talk about the young god, the growing god, the youth that we're going to talk about today. Even though he's not really explicitly called like a part of a triplicate, the young god is still talked about in a lot of these older books like the spiral dance. acknowledged but not labeled as such. >> Exactly. Exactly. >> So tonight we're going to explore the youth aspect of the god. That rising sun energy. You know, I kind of look at at this aspect as the buildup, that little baby son born making his way to adulthood. >> Oh, see now I see him more as a mischievous teen. I see I see the young god as more more of a later teens getting ready to go to college age >> like a chaotic teenager. >> A chaotic teenager almost ready to be into adulthood but not quite. I guess I do see him as the baby around Ule. But in my mind he goes straight from being the baby at Ule to being like that young chaotic teenager immediately afterwards. >> Well, I I could see you know both of those things within this particular aspect kind of that. Yeah, he does contain both of those for sure. All of that, the whole range of it. I think >> you know, kind of that starting out like you said that that little ule baby who hasn't made it to his beltain phase yet. He's got that little growing season. >> Yeah. And I mean, if you look at the god as aspects of a wheel, like aspects of the wheel of the year, it is cyclical. The whole idea of the god is he's born, he grows up, he becomes the lover of the goddess, the father of her child, he becomes the wise elder sage, and then he becomes the god of death and gives himself in sacrifice to go within and become the baby in the goddess's womb and be born again. And the whole wheel starts, >> similar to the maiden, mother and crown. >> Exactly. So the youth aspect encompasses everywhere from that moment of conception in the womb all the way to that moment just before he becomes the warrior, the father. >> Right. >> So he's still connected to death even on that one side of it. >> Exactly. Exactly. Like the triple goddess aspect. same thing when we think of the god and I think what maybe quote unquote society thinks of as the god is really kind of more that middle aspect that warrior father aspect and I think that you really don't hear a lot about the youth or the sage aspect much >> I mean there's Odin people like the whole idea of Odin as the big god with the beard and the patch and he's in charge of everything >> I see him as like the sage >> I see him that way too. But and not to get sidetracked from the young god, but I just brought up Odin to point out that he is more proof that the dual aspect of the god, the father warrior and sage death aspects, those two aspects are still more popular than the idea of the young growing god. You know, like you said with Odin in that sage aspect, you know, he kind of does represent that wisdom and that knowledge so to say, whereas the youth aspect, youth is more as the beginnings and in the growth of things. I think of usually when I think of the youth god, I almost think of crops. I don't know why. >> No, spring. He's all about imbul and oara >> and things like just bursting out of the ground. I have visions. When I think of the youth God, I think of things like just shooting out of the ground. You know what I mean? >> Exactly. Me, too. Absolutely. He is He is that God of growth. He's that God of potential. He's that God of absolute beginnings, >> but uncertainty. >> Yes. He's the fool. He's the fool. He's that careless youth who's a little prepared, but he's ready to take a step off the cliff and he's not even looking where he's going. >> Just like the fool card in the tarot. >> Yep. Just like that. And and I I love thinking of it like that. that whole cycle. He is that youth that's starting the fool's journey. He is that young god that's ready to step off into the unknown and to start this whole wheel of the year. >> When I think of youth gods or maybe youth god isn't the right word, I think of soul. And I think that's just because of the whole sun aspect >> and Belle. Belle's another one. Yeah. the god Belle because you know Belain he is the god of fire and the god of sun and he's very youthful >> you know I know that with soul is part of a Christmas festival so it kind of goes with the whole baby u thing but I think it's just mainly because for me a sun god that little baby son I don't know why I think of the youthful as a little baby I'm sorry but that little baby son so that's really kind of when I'm when I'm thinking of or trying to work with a youthful aspect of the god. Soul is kind of where I where I start with. >> Even in our practice, we tended to ignore the youth aspect of the god in favor of the oak king and the holly king. And so when we did think of that youth aspect, we thought of the pregnant goddess. We thought of the god in her belly and then we thought of him being born at ule. You know, that makes a lot of sense that you see him as the baby because it that's what's really emphasized a lot. >> You know, it's funny you say that because I'm thinking back to the last time I worked with soul and it was around the time that I uh ironically found myself being the goddess in that story >> and had yourself pregnant with a son that you had asked the gods for. I remember that. >> Who was born right around Imbulk, >> right? Perfect. Yes. Exactly. the youthful god time, you know, that spring energy, that beginning energy. And now, we've kind of danced around this a little bit and I I just want to point out for our listeners that the goddess is very closely associated to the moon. You know, we talk about that the phases of the moon mirror the phases of the goddess, mirror a person's life stages, and we've mentioned it a couple times, but I want to point out specifically that the god is very much tied to the sun. >> The sun. Yeah. in this tradition. There are other traditions that will flip that and they'll have the goddess associated with the sun and the god associated with the moon, but in in a lot of pagan and wiccan and witchcraft traditions, it's goddess moon, god sun. And he follows that cyclical nature, that solar seasonal year-long cycle where he's born at Ule, he grows up, he becomes the consort of the goddess at Beltain, and then he dies at Sin. So yeah, he has he has a very cyclical nature much like the goddesses, but his is a whole year. His follows the solar yearly cycle and hers follows the monthly lunar >> monthly lunar. Yep. And I think that maybe you know also kind of the elephant in the room. I think that sometimes the reason that not only the god in general but the three aspects of the god sometimes get washed over. You know, a lot of people do find themselves on this path as recovering Christians. And I think that sometimes there is a fear of working with the God or they're almost put off by diving into the into the God, let alone the aspects of the God. And that made me think of Christianity actually also has its own triple aspect of the God. >> Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. >> Yeah. Yeah. But I I think that even if you are a recovering Christian, that you're only giving yourself 50% of the magic if you're only working with 50% of the magic. You know what I mean? And I think that people would very much find that if you are apprehensive about working with the God that you may find comfort delving in starting with working with each aspect starting with that sweet baby sun god. >> Yeah. That youthful energetic excited to do new things sun god. Yeah. That's perfect. >> Can I tell you something horrible? All I can think of right now is that little sun baby in Teletubbies where the sun in the sky was a big baby face. >> Yeah. No, that's cute. That's a very cute way to think of it. And that is a very accessible and easy way to get into working with the god. When I got into witchcraft, when I read the spiral dance and realized that deity didn't just have to be one god, one sky daddy telling you what to do, but that there was feminine energy involved as well. There was goddess and you had to have that balance. And the idea of it was so attractive to me. I I was so drawn to that. And so a lot of people are drawn to finding out as much as they can about that goddess, that feminine side. This is energy that we all possess in different levels. And just like you said, Shell, we have to have all of >> the balance. Yeah. >> Yeah. There has to be some type of balance within you. And that's what these books, particularly a lot of the older ones were saying. They were saying that you have to have both. They were saying that duality is important, right? Even though there was a lot of wickah in them that I no longer follow, that idea of duality in the universe, of balance, of finding that in all things, that really appeals to me. You know, I came for the goddess, but I stayed for the goddess and the god. That duality is very important. >> The ying and the yang. >> Recently, I've started working with Odin. That wasn't my fault. It happened. >> I love that. It wasn't my fault. >> It wasn't. But it all started. Okay. Side. Okay. We got to go on a side track. >> Left turn. >> Left turn. And it's Odin's fault. I'm blaming him. >> That's because you talked about him in the sage and now he's here and now. >> Crystal City Circle. My wonderful, amazing, awesome pagan community in Corning, New York. Absolutely fabulous group of people. We just recently did our sin celebration. Jealous. Keep going. >> It was amazing. These are people of all different levels of practicing. We have people been practicing for a very long time. We have people who are new, different traditions and it just all blends beautifully together. And we got together to decide how we wanted to do our sound ritual. And the group decided that we wanted to call the Norse deities of hell and Odin. >> Ooh yikes. Jeez. >> Damn, I missed this. >> And Odin immediately said, you're calling me Leila. And I said, okay, cuz that's all you really can say at that point. See, you're so much better than I am because I would have been like, why? No, I did not want to say why. I just said, "Okay, >> that's why I find myself in trouble sometimes." >> Yeah. And then, of course, I found myself going down a rabbit hole of research and meditation and working with Odin. But it it was very, very good and it was very fabulous. But I just want to give a shout out to Crystal City Circle. And thanks, guys, cuz now I'm working with Odin and it's all your fault. But I also want to give a particular shout out to Shannon, who is my partner in crime for this. Thank you so so much. You're amazing. Couldn't do it without you. >> She is pretty fabulous, by the way. >> Oh my gosh, she's freaking fantastic. I could not have asked for a better person to start. >> I already love her. >> I know. Isn't she great? I adore her. Um, there's also one other person that I want to shout out, and this is Matt. >> Matt, thank you so much for including me. It makes me want to cry. So Matt says his love language is giving and he is not kidding. He brought to our sin feast riches from his farm. He brought us eggs and feathers shell actually. Okay, I stole the feathers. But I have I have I looked at them and I was like look at these feathers. He actually has stories. I know what birds these feathers came from and it is the coolest thing. >> That's very cool. >> Right. I saw them and thought that they were perfect and I already have magical projects planned for every single one of them. Now, part of the reason I'm bringing up Matt is he's about to become a dad and so he has that father energy, you know, that father god, but I can still see the optimism, the the positivity, the growth, the growing things. I mean, he works with the land for sake. >> But he's on the precipice of going to the next phase. >> I think he's already there. the responsibility, the wisdom is already there. I can just see the hints of the youth god that was once there. You know what I'm saying? >> You can see it fading away. >> But that's a sad way to put it. But yeah, >> but growing into something more. How's that? Growing. And that's what that's what all of this is about is phases. You know, the phases of your life. And that's what it's supposed to mirror is the seasons. How you relate to the seasons, how your life relates to the gods. And so like Matt, I'm so sorry, but like like Matt >> going from the young god to the father god. These are phases of life that we should acknowledge. Whether this matches your gender or not, I don't care. We all go through these in different ways and we all express this in different ways, but we all go through phases and stages of our life. And that's what these deity stories and aspects are supposed to teach us. Well, Matt, now that we've talked about you, there you go. Now that we've had our left turn again, thank you so much. You are such a sweetheart. I appreciate you, >> man. He brought vanilla that he made. >> How can you hate that? You can't. But everybody is so cool. People were doing readings. We pulled runes. They cast circle. Everyone was so supportive and so wonderful. And I got a book and I'm so excited. It was from Nicole. So, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I did promise a book back, so I'm gonna have to get a tarot book for our swap. But yeah, I'm loving it. And I'm hogging the conversation again. Can you tell I'm really in love with my community? I'm in love with my community. I just want to put out there, I don't want this to sound one-sided in any way, shape, or form, but as of the time of this recording, I have not yet had my sin ritual with my coven. So, I can't brag about it cuz it hasn't happened yet. And it's not that I don't love them, and it's not that they're not fabulous. I mean, it's not you, but >> that's the one missing piece. >> I just can't brag about it cuz it hasn't happened yet. >> That's okay. You guys do cool stuff. >> We do. We're just We're just a little more ceremonial than you, that's all. >> Except when it comes to snacks afterwards. Has there been any honey corn chip dipping happening lately? >> This sounds like stoner witch coven snacks. I'm just saying. >> Seriously. Seriously. like like my coven eats the best >> I don't remember what episode it is. If future Leila figures it out, I will put a link. But in a past episode, we did talk about Shell's coven and their cakes and nails ceremony. And I think the person that was supposed to bring one of your traditional snacks couldn't make it. >> Yeah. Couldn't come. And >> so you substituted you substituted corn chips for the cornbread you usually had. >> Right. And you still had to use the honey. So, it's corn and chips and honey, man. Let's do this. >> It was surprisingly fantastic if I remember correctly. >> It freaking was. But yeah, so I'm not bragging only because it hasn't happened yet, but I still love them. >> I love them, too. >> Back to God. >> But the thing is is in our covens, we have men and women. We have everybody. There's room for all of us here. >> We got people. That's what we got. We got people. >> We have people. And that's the thing is deities are aspects of people. There are aspects of nature and of these bigger cycles and relating yourself to where you are in these aspects. Or you know with the youth god if you want to start something new maybe the the youthful god energy maybe you need to call soul the sun god and ask for that energy so that you can start something new. How many of us have done rituals for new beginnings? Whether that's new beginnings at a job or new beginnings in life or hell, new beginnings as far as having a baby, buying a house, whatever the case may be. Why wouldn't you use a god for new beginnings? >> Exactly. And the idea of growth doesn't have to be plants and growing things. >> Could be personal personal growth. >> Exactly. Personal growth. It could be growing your family, growing your business, growing your home, growing your connection of friends, whatever type of growth you want. If you need energy to start something new, that seed of beginning, that potential energy, call a youthful god. They're all about the newness. And one of the things you said earlier about the god reminding you of um growing plants, like the new new things bursting. >> Yeah. reminded me of Raven Gasi is an Italian spiritualist and they've written a book and they talk about the youth god. There's a lot of different names for these three aspects and a common one is youth warrior sage. Raven uses um the hooded one for youth, the horned one and the old one for the elder. The idea of the hooded one is the green man. So growing things and plants just like you had said earlier. >> That makes sense. The green man, the horned god, the sage. Yeah. >> You know, the green man is isn't that baby aspect. So that might help you sometimes to see the two different sides of the youth as the child and the young man. I mean, the green man appears to me as a a much older youth, right? >> Like, sorry, Matt. Like Matt, because you know, he's because he's a young man. He's not technically a youth. He's a person with responsibilities who is taking on more responsibilities while still honoring the creativity, energy, and optimism of youth. His life right now seems to fit into the stage of the young god who is also the father warrior god. >> Yeah. >> I guess my point is is that if you look at the god cycle as the whole wheel of the year, it's easier that way to look at it as like a sliding scale. You know, we all fall into those in between spots between youth and adult, adult and sage, or, you know, somewhere on that wheel. It's very rare that we'll fit neatly into one of those boxes. And the gods don't fit neatly into boxes either. These stages are more like a sliding scale. >> I love that. Like, so, so the youth aspect can range anywhere from a soul to the green band. >> Exactly. Yes. that little baby aspect, you know, all the way from the baby in the womb to that first spark of life is the youth god, that spark. >> Yeah. >> And so part of the wisdom of the fool, part of the wisdom of the youth is that kids aren't afraid to fall off their bike and get back on again. And sometimes when we get older, we get scared to fall off our bike cuz it's going to hurt. >> Yeah. >> We might chip a tooth or break a bone or something, you know? So we we don't want to go through that pain, but youth almost will fall off the bike, jump back up on it, and try the ramp again. >> Yeah. >> And and so sometimes you need to recapture that energy. Sometimes you need that. He's not just birth and growth. There's wisdom in trying and failing and getting up again. >> There's wisdom in change and challenge. There's wisdom in change and challenge. >> And there's wisdom in failure and keeping on doing it anyway. Trying it a different way. trying it again, readjusting. Exactly. Exactly. That's that youth energy to me is that not being afraid to fail and not being afraid to try. >> So, I think really the important thing, the biggest takeaway is not only should you be diving into the God as much as you are the goddess, but all three aspects or you're shortch changing yourself. >> There's so much fabulous, wonderful energy. And we need that balance. We need to honor all of these aspects of ourselves. And I don't think we do usually. >> I would think as far as calling in the youthful aspect of the god, you know, kind of have it be a little more playful. You know, when I call in the maiden aspect, it's more I try to think of calling in the maiden is is evoking my teenage self. So for me, and and you know, you've changed my perspective tonight. I always thought of it as invoking that burst of beginning, that burst of newness, the beginning of the heat, the beginning of the warmth. But now I'm taking it I I I'm going to have to take a step back because I know how I would invoke the green man. And I kind of never really thought I kind of thought as the green man and the horned one kind of in in that same category. >> They kind of are. I mean, the green man kind of walks that line between both of them. So does Kunos. So does the horned one. I mean, you can see Kunos as the button buck, >> a younger aspect, but then closer to the sage aspect. >> If you didn't grow up in the backwoods of upstate New York and have a hunter for a father, a button buck is the is the very young buck. They have the little teeny tiny just little tiny bumps on the top of their head. Think Bambi from Disney. Before he gets the full rack of antlers, a button buck has little tiny buttons of horns on his head. That is also Kerunos, but that's him in his youthful aspect. >> But he's also Ker Nunos with the big full rack. >> Oh, he's hot Kunos with the shoulders and the rack and the asking you to walk the forest paths with them in the moonlight. Yeah, that's Kunos. >> Yeah. >> So, the youthful aspect though is that cute little button buck in the field that's bouncing around having a good old time playing with the skunk and the bunny, right? But he's also the responsible almost adult that's about to set off on his first adventure. So when you call upon him or want to honor him, you can think of him in any of those aspects from the young god as the first spark of life, the baby, the pre-teen, and the almost adult. Any of these aspects are the youth god. And you can set up your altar to reflect his qualities of beginnings, of adventure, of life. you know, you don't have to settle for just one quality of that aspect. >> So now I kind of would look at it a little differently, I guess, because I'm used to, you know, invoking that energy, but never thought of it as the youthful aspect. >> Try new things. Put fresh green things, bright green on your altar. Green scents, sun, like I love that you kept mentioning the sun, little suns, dawn, working with new beginnings. This is also um would be where I would maybe use seeds too because like I said I think of it as kind of you know that spark of beginning that burst of growth. Um so seeds would be also something I would put on my altar as a representation. You know I do have a it's the cutest darn thing. It's a little baby and it used to be my gr my grandma's little baby Jesus in her um Christmas what do they call that thing? um manger nativity >> nativity scene and so it was my grandma's little baby Jesus and I don't know how I acquired it when she died but I ended up with just the little baby Jesus not the nativity scene >> well he is the son god that's born yeah >> so I have used that little baby Jesus on my altar as a representation of the sun god >> and I like that >> it's like a ceramic thing and he's like laying in a little straw manger it's actually kind of cute >> it's adorable >> but that is what I have used is is is kind of like an alter representation. >> Typically, I see him as more as the young man, the youthful man that's getting ready to go off on his first adventures. So, you know, you could even see that as someone that's college-aged, getting ready to go off on college, is still the youthful god. >> Well, and I do have I do have a youthful looking Kerunos statue that maybe I'll see if that gives me some of that youthful phase energy. You know, some gods, like some goddesses, can have all of those aspects in themselves, right? >> Take Lou for example. Lou is the the Celtic god of crafts, right? He's clever and his story is kind of a coming of age story, right? So, he's definitely the youth going up to father to warrior, >> right? >> So, for Lou, one of the things that I could use to represent him as the youth might be a craft that I'm just starting to learn. You know, maybe I'm trying a new stitch in crochet or let's face it, I kind of suck at crocheting. It doesn't matter how long I've been doing it. I'm still a dabbler. So maybe I'm trying something new, a new craft, and I might put that on my altar as a representation of Lou. It doesn't have to be a literal representation. You know, I have another weird thing. You know how I get weird about things? I generally find working with this aspect of the god kind of a seasonal thing. Truly >> in the spring. >> Well, yeah. But like once it season's over, like I don't generally dabble with the youthful aspect of the god in say late August. You know what I'm saying? >> Maybe it's because some witches don't see the power or potential in youth. Sometimes people see youth and innocence and think less powerful and less useful to their life right now. But there's importance in all stages of life, in all of these qualities, no matter where you're at in your stage of life. And I think it's too easy to get stuck in that duality, especially as adults. You want to forget the kid part, right? You want to stay with the two, the young adult and the sage. Two, morning to afternoon, afternoon to night. Two two aspects. You can break it up into three, but it's the oak king. It's the holly king. It's the It's almost four gods, right? The oak king is really the baby god growing up to the youth to the young man becoming the father. And then he switches and he becomes the sage, but he's still the young man. He's still the father. He's still vibrant and bright. And now he's going down. He's becoming the death god. He's sacrificing himself on that wheel of the year. And then continuing along the wheel back to the spark of life as the newly conceived baby, as the newly conceived god. So it's almost like there's four if you really want to look at it. It's it's funny you say that because you know some folks look at the four aspects of the goddess as the maidened mother warrior crone >> and in that specific order but with the god I could see the four aspects being the youth the warrior the father the crone and I think that for whatever reason I feel like with the goddess she becomes the mother and then the warrior and with the god he's the warrior who becomes the father and it maybe is because it's that baby youthful stage and the warrior maybe is what I see as that late teen early 20s kind of stage. >> I mean it's it's really like a wheel like we were saying earlier. So wherever you want to kind of divide that wheel it's kind of like trying to figure out where Gen X and Millennial and Gen Z where the dividing here is. You know you you kind of figure out which stage of the god you want to section out and work with someone with that kind of aspect. You can kind of pick anywhere on there and divide it into two, three, four, however you want to do it. >> Whatever works for you, man. >> Yeah. Right. It's also a good idea to remember that not only are the stages not exactly linear, they're also not literal. For you and I, we are both mothers. So, that fits, right? Well, I know a lot of people our age who aren't mothers, who don't want to be mothers, who have zero desire to be a mother, or who wanted to be and couldn't for whatever reason. And mother energy doesn't have to mean bearing children, >> right? >> Mother energy can mean so many other things. It can mean protective. It can mean nurturing. It can mean growing new things, you know, and and so I really wish we could come up with different names for the phases that maybe were a little more modern. It made a lot of sense when I was a kid, but I think we've kind of outgrown them, you know. I think we've kind of grown up a little bit. We need something a little new and different. Which is also why I think the fourth face of the goddess is getting more I mean I know we'll talk about this in a later episode but you know the four faces >> get more traction. >> Yeah. Because the warrior aspect of women is very important. We need to embrace that. And and I think the idea of mother and father even though I think they're outdated terms they do kind of fit especially if you look at them as their archetypal energies and not as literal mom and dad. >> But I think they're both separate from that warrior aspect as well. >> I totally agree. And and I love seeing that it is four, but I think it's hard enough for people to separate the god into three parts instead of two. >> I'd love four. >> Yeah. So, we're going to we're going to start with three and then we'll ease people into four, shall we? We're going to we'll just start with the three, get them used to the idea, and and then we'll throw that fourth one on them later. We're not going to make it an eight-part series now. We already said seven. Damn it. On that note, well, I think that's it for talking about the youthful god. And again, if there's a god like Lou or Apollo, Pan or Carnunos, Dionis, Angus Og, a lot of these will fit other aspects of the god as well. Youth warrior or sage. They're very rarely going to be just one. You could say, "Hey, that seems more like a warrior god or more like a father god." Yeah, okay. Sure, probably. >> Whatever works. >> Whatever works. But if he's got that youthful aspect, whether physically or mentally, you know, if he's got that new beginnings, that ready to accept a challenge and start new fresh things, that still fits with that youthful god aspect. >> And you know, another thing for all you tarot enthusiasts, got to always turn something into tarot. You can even if if you're struggling on finding a youthful aspect of the god to pull on, pull on the fool. The fool is is the one that I go to almost every single time for the young god. Sometimes I will use the sun as well to represent any aspect of the god from the youth to the warrior to the sage. Uh sometimes the sun card in tarot gives off that god kind of energy, >> right? >> I I do like occasionally pages or knights work, but that doesn't give me god energy so much as major arcana does. So >> yeah, >> but the fool just really embodies that so much. that leaping off into that unknown, that that willingness to take the chance, >> carefree, >> that carefree energy that's can be so powerful, that new beginning energy, that rebirth from death energy that that is so so vital and powerful. On that note, thank you so much for joining us for this first of our seven-part series on the aspects of the god and goddess. >> This is what happens when you like our first series. We do more. >> Yeah, that's true. Don't encourage us people. We just tend to go in weird places. But yeah, we're having a lot of fun with this. It's an excellent topic. So, thank you all so much for listening. Please like, subscribe, give us some stars, some reviews. It really helps the show out, helps people to find us, and it makes Shell and I cackle like little witches. >> Stay wise, stay wicked, >> and keep it witchy.

----------------------------------------
Welcome to Back on the Broomstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimmooire, where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots after a long period of mundanity. >> We're rewalking the path of the wise, and trying out all the latest spells, rituals, and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices. >> So, grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron, and your crystals, >> and join us as we get back on the broomstick. Hi and welcome to Back on the Broomstick. I'm this Halloween spooky episode, we're going to be telling you some ghost stories. We've each picked out trueish tales of the paranormal from somewhere in the USA. And I'm Shell. And you know, I love this time of year for a bunch of bunch of different reasons. But the one thing that ever since I was a small child that I have always loved about this time of year, the sin season, October, Halloween, getting darker earlier, is ghost stories. You know, Ila, what better thing to give folks on our Halloween sin episode than some ghost stories. So tonight we are going to do kind of a back on the broomstick stoned witches hour twisty and bring you some ghosties. But I want to start with my inspiration. So we pick locations randomly. Um actually I still don't know what Ila's going to talk about and and where and who and what ghosty spirits, but knowing Ila like I do, I got a sneaking suspicion there's going to be a lady in white tonight. But a shout out to our beloved Helen Jojo. >> We love you, Helen. Thank you so much for everything you do. >> So, actually, she is who inspired my choice for tonight. So, Helen made a comment on our Facebook discussion group about wanting to do ghost hunts and maybe finding some locally. So, Helen, I have found a couple ghosty places near you. We are definitely no strangers to very amateur ghost hunts. And what better time than the Halloween season to talk about ghosts, ghouls, and things that go bump in the night. >> Well, it's a good time to actually go ghost hunting. Who wants to go ghost hunting in February? Like, it's cold, man. >> Right. Not only is the atmosphere conducive, but they do say that the veil is thinner, meaning the barrier between the living and the dead is kind of thin to non-existent this time of year. And also, interestingly enough, at Beltain, which it is in the southern hemisphere, hey Australia, happy Beltane. >> Shout out to New Zealand. >> The veil is also thin at that time of year as well. The dead are restless this time of year and they want to come back. So, we tell ghost stories as warnings, I guess, and also as it's kind of fun. Like I said, the atmosphere this time of year is more conducive to being scared. So, it it's a good time of year to go ghost hunting and tell chilling tales. Well, I want to start off with I actually got two locations I I want to talk about, but I want to talk about my first location, which I hear you. Finale, October, May, Belain, Sin, like I get it, but places like what we're going to talk about tonight are kind of spooky wooky all year round. Like, I get the thin veil thing, but you go in there in a late July night and it's still spooky wookie. >> The thin veil just means that things are more likely to happen. your beloved dead are more likely to come around. And also that the spirits of places and the dead that roam certain places might be more active, but that doesn't mean that they're not around other times of the year. And that doesn't mean that some places and some spooky events aren't creepy and crawly with ghosts all year round. And I'm guessing that you have a place that's spooky every part of the year. >> I do. We are going to take a little trip tonight to the outskirts of Cincinnati, Ohio. And I laugh because being from New York, we have in New York what's called the tri-state area. The New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania region. Ohio has a tri-state area, too. Who knew? I for the life of me can't think of off the top of my head what the other two states are. But Illinois, Indiana, do not quote me. Do not send me messages that I don't know geography because I'm already aware of this. You're You're doing a story out of Ohio. >> Ohio? >> I I'm doing one out of Illinois. >> That's next door. >> Yeah. Yeah. We We picked We picked states right next to each other. >> You want to see my surprised face? I'm in Ohio. I am in the outskirts of Cincinnati, Ohio. And there's a little old cemetery there called the Hopewell Cemetery. >> Hopewell. That sounds like awfully optimistic name for a place where dead people go. You know, I never thought of it that way. Oh my gosh, you're right. >> I mean, what are we hoping for? A well of mystery. I don't know. >> Calm and and serene afterlife. >> Now, supposedly, I'm no expert. This is the most haunted location in Ohio. They say Helen Jojo is going to have to back us up on this one. >> I'm having flashbacks to our stoned witches hour days. Every location is the most most haunted in America. All of them >> in the tri state area >> in the world. >> And it's probably got a portal of hell somewhere, too. >> I didn't find that, but I bet you it does. >> If we kept digging, it probably is there. But most haunted location in Ohio. I love it. All right. >> Okay. So, it's most haunted location. Now, it is located in a place called College Corner, Ohio. >> Oh, yeah. Colleges are always scary places. Seriously, I think what got me the most with this particular one, they say that it is one of the best ghost hunting sites in southern Ohio. They claim strange lights can be regularly seen, you know, like flashing lights as if there were someone in the woods turning on and off flashlights, but they've had people there. They've had professional ghost hunters and they have secured the perimeter and there's absolutely no one there shining lights. There's also some apparitions here. There are folks that say that they have seen apparitions literally rise from the ground as if the folks were literally rising from their grave. Okay, Ila, I got to admit, if I'm walking around a cemetery, and you know how we are, I probably have smoked a little bit of the Devil's Lettuce. So, I'm feeling good. I'm walking around and if I just happen to look over and I see like this ghost laying rising up from the ground and slowly stand up. Yes, I'm probably gonna pee myself. >> Yeah, that does sound pretty creepy. So, people have actually seen that. >> That's what they say. That's what they say. And actually, I I did a lot of digging on this and there were several instances on multiple sites that said this. So, this wasn't like a one and done. Someone one person said this. So, that's a little bit creepy. There's also a theory that there's a superstition. And you know how I am when you tell me part of a story and won't tell me the ending because then I absolutely have to go find out the ending. They say that if you go there at night, >> when else are you going to go ghost hunting? >> If you're going Jesus. So, they say that if you go at night, that if you leave your car, and this is a legend, apparently a well-known legend. Again, I need Helen Jojo to back me up on this. So, this well-known legend says that if you leave your car and walk through the cemetery, you will return and find a startling surprise inside your vehicle. Now, first of all, that takes me back to the very first time I went to Fallbrook with the baby bonnet in the car. But this is where you are provoking me. It's like poking the damn bear. They say those who claim to have experienced this refuse to reveal what it is and that basically they just call it the surprise. I need to know what the surprise is. Okay. >> So, this is like some secret item that only people that have seen this particular apparition get. >> No, not even an apparition. It just says that if you leave your car and walk through the cemetery, you're going to you're going to return to your car and find a startling surprise inside your vehicle. Like, are we talking candy? Like, what? I need to know. >> They're practically begging for us to go park a car there. >> Literally, they are provoking me into a road trip to Ohio. >> Obviously, they don't know us. Here's the thing. Every single place that I did research on this says that they're literally saying shall come to Ohio. >> That's what I heard. >> And you and I both know that Helen Jojo will put us up for the night just so we can go to the cemetery. So like they're provoking me. >> All right, I'm packing up the car once I can extract you from the crowds of Salem road trip. So, they also say that a specific eerie light in the cemetery is associated with bad luck for those who come too close to it. But they don't say the origin of the light. So, like I don't know if this is like a random light that appears, don't walk near it or you get bad luck. They're not really specific. It just says a specific eerie light in the cemetery is associated with bad luck for those who come close to it. >> Is it a bad luck orb? Is it a glowing orb at night that brings bad luck? I know it wouldn't bring me bad luck. It would bring me good luck. I know it. >> But like I said, they do talk about mysterious lights. Um unexplained lights such they say there's um one example is lantern like lights or floating balls of light moving through the cemetery. >> Orbs. >> Orbs. Yeah. Yeah. >> Obviously that's orbs. >> And then of course the voices. I I can't say I've been to a cemetery where I haven't heard voices. Oh, this is like nothing to me. But they say that you hear clear voices that seem to come from all around despite the cemetery being isolated. Again, reminds me exactly of Fbrook. Like I said, they're literally making me want to go. There is there is a a story that they like to take boys like to take girls out there. We'll call it for a first date and we'll leave it at that. and they like to explore things with their female friend in this cemetery. Well, there's a legend that kids would go out there try to do the chick in the cemetery and they'd be mid act and all of the sudden one or both of them would be like totally frozen like almost the way it was described it sound like um what do they call that? Sleep paralysis. >> Yeah. But it's like sex paralysis. >> You know, it's interesting because a lot of these ghost stories, you'll find them around places. Either the ghost stories exist and so it turns into a makeout spot or it's a makeout spot and then suddenly ghost stories erupt around it. Yes, you are right. My ghost story is a Lady and White story, but particularly in America, Lady and White and Hitchhiker stories that I'll get into later are kind of morality tales in a lot of ways. And so these ghost stories sometimes will spring up around places where young people go to either party, make out, whatever. So I'm not surprised. >> Well, it really did kind of give me this because you know the creepy woods, kids having sex and getting paralyzed halfway through. It gave me a very Friday the 13th Jason Vorhees vibe. >> Do they How long does it take them to unfreeze? Do they say they see anything? Are they scared stiff? You know, what's causing this freezing? They don't know. It's It's kind of like the other piece, you know, with the surprise. They ain't telling. They're provoking me to go to Ohio. Ila, >> they're provoking you to not only go to Ohio and leave your car, but to also have sex in the cemetery and see if one of you freezes up. >> Yeah, that's basically the challenge. >> Okay. I I've heard this challenge. Loud and clear. >> So, basically, those are the things I have found about this particular place. >> That sounds like a very active cemetery. And it it sounds like that pretty much anybody who goes there comes back with some sort of story. There are professional ghost hunters that have gotten videos of of the or we'll call them orbs, videos of the orbs. They've been able to get on their recorders, you know, voice recordings of things. You know, just like with every cemetery, there's the the Banshee stories. But from all accounts, this does absolutely seem like a legit extra haunted. I mean, I kind of look at every cemetery as haunted in a sense, but this is like one of those, okay, let's let's make sure we, you know, like Fall Brook, I'm bringing my stones. I'm cleansing when I get home. You know, I'm making sure I cut ties before I get in the car. like this is a cemetery that sounds like you need to take it seriously if you are going to go and tussle with its occupants. >> Did anyone have any theories as to why this particular place was so active? >> No, I never saw any theories as to why. The cemetery dates back to like the mid to late 1800s, but there was really no rhyme or reason, I guess. And I'm theorizing here. Um, I I didn't find anything to base this other than me theorizing, but when you're talking, you know, mid to late 1800s, the Civil War was going on, you know, there was food shortages, there was disease spreading, >> a lot of tragic deaths, >> the whole bit out, you know, and, you know, you're talking in Ohio in that time period, you know, this wasn't, you know, one of the bustling coastal towns. These were places that were still getting settled and stuff. And I just think it was just an area that just had a lot of dead people that weren't ready to be dead, so they stuck around. >> A lot of these places that have people who died young or died tragically, they do tend to be more active than others. That's one of the reasons people think Fbrook is so active is because it was a lot of children that died in a very short period of time and a lot of young adults that died tragically. And again in the same period of time when there was famine there was you know Fbrook had tragedy and the town dissolved but a lot of these places in these particular time periods you know they always say especially with Gettysburg you get you get folks that died in the war they don't know they're dead shade keeps trying to do the same things over and over again. I I am going to put my fighting gloves on. I have a bone to pick with both Hopewell and Fbrook. Okay, spill your beans. >> These two places have a reputation for having a banshee, and that's going to make me crazy. Now, I'm no Morgan Dameler. I I am no historian of the she here, but I do know my banshees. Banshees are a type of she. They're a type of fay. They usually appear as women, sometimes as old, haggarded women with wild, crazy hair, bony hands, very scary. Stop describing me on a Saturday night. >> Us after a few too many whisies. Now these women, these she these banshee are usually tied to a place or a bloodline. They herald death. When they scream, if you hear them scream, that means either you or someone you love is about to die. They are an announcer of death. They don't announce that. Hey, dead people are here. Ghosts are here. No, no, no. They announce the death of the living. So, there are no banshees at Fbrook or Hopewell because if you hear a banshee scream, you're [ __ ] And you're not happy about it. And people would be talking about all the deaths that happen after they hear the banshee scream. So, they might be hearing a ghost scream. Maybe they're hearing an unearly scream. But it drives me nuts when people say that it's a banshee because that's not a banshee. That's not what a banshee does. You know, I I did hear I did hear a scream at Fbrook. I could see how someone who maybe doesn't know enough I don't know a nice way to say it. someone who hasn't explored the aspects of banshees in in the she all you know about banshees is it's something screaming in the woods supernatural okay >> yeah something supernatural screaming in the woods that I can buy >> unintentionally misnaming it but yes you can just have random ghosty screaming in the woods and damn it ain't a banshee >> yeah right exactly you know it's some sort of weird supernatural scream and it could be all sorts of things but and we did mention that in Fbrook there was a very large Scottish population there. So maybe, you know, we were saying that it that one could possibly be a banshee, maybe tied to one of the families that came there, but then you'd have to ask people when they hear the screaming, you know. But did you die though? Or did someone that you love die? Then we'll know for sure if it's a banshee or not. >> Okay, I'm going to sideline myself here for a minute. I do have a theory though on screaming ghosties. >> Okay, >> I agree with you. every screamer ain't a banshee. But I personally, this is my own belief. Um, this is based on personal experience and not based on anything else. I have always believed when I hear screaming ghosties that those ghosties, you know, how some spirits are well intended and some are a little more ill. >> I feel like the screamers are ill. >> Oh, interesting theory. And that would be another good reason to say that it's not a banshee because banshees aren't screaming to hurt you. They're not screaming to cause a death. They're basically an announcer. >> Like if you're hearing children in a cemetery, you're not going to, you know, children playing or laughing or crying that doesn't bring a sense of negativity. So I have always associated screaming ghosties with ill-willed ghosties. >> There you go. Yeah, definitely a time to have whip out that black termine. And >> not a banshee, but I feel like the screamers are ill. >> Exactly. And banshees don't intend ill. They're not causing the death. They're just announcing it. So that's another that's another clue that it's something something more malevolent maybe. >> So as far as the Hopewell Cemetery, I need an Ohio resident to go there and give me the dirt on this place. You need This is my homework to all Ohio residents. You need to go and report back to Ila and I because I I want to know what the surprise is. I want to know the surprise. >> I want to go there and do some ghost hunting because it sounds like you're going to get some EVPs. You're going to get some ghost orbs. And I'm excited. I'm about to add a Polaroid camera to my tape deck. And >> I'm still working on getting clear recordings that sound like something more than of our possible EVPs for people. So, if anybody knows a good way to get stuff from a very old tape recorder to digital, let me know. I got one more one more quick story from Ohio that that I just couldn't resist. And and you know, this one I had to do for you because as I predicted, didn't take a psychic for this. You have a damn lady in white story. And I love that you do because in Cincinnati there's a little old place called the Hilton. Hiltons are always fancymancy. Um but this is the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza. Well, damn. That's a name. So, this place has has something that's right up your alley, Ila. >> Oh, are you saying they have a full service weed bar? >> Actually, it might. We should go check it out. >> Now, what is my favorite color? And it's okay to tell the listeners. >> Green. >> Okay. So, the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza has a lady in green. What? Not a lady in white. >> Not a lady in white. A freaking lady in green. >> Well, that's kind of cool. >> There's a lot of cities across the country that have like the ghost tour thing going on. So, this hotel is actually at the top of the list of all ghost hunts in the Cincinnati area. So, the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza is like an art deco uh type hotel opened in 1931. Um, and it was a hotel that had like literally a half of acre of Brazilian rosewood paneling. Like they went all out. >> Wow. >> Here, >> here's one reason I need to see this place. They have what's called a hall of mirrors designed after the palace of Versailles. >> Wow. Fancy. >> I know. Winston Churchill stayed here and you know I love English royal history and Winston Churchill was Queen Elizabeth's favorite prime minister. >> Well, yeah. That's pretty close to royalty. Close enough for Shell. >> Close enough. He was so impressed with the bathroom. Why are men totally in bathrooms? Can I just ask this question? As long as they're bigger than the Hawthorne Hotel bathrooms, we're good. >> No joke. So Winston Churchill was so impressed with the bathroom that he had an exact replica put in his house. >> Damn. If Winston Churchill is stealing your [ __ ] design, then you know you're pretty fancy. >> It must be fancy. >> So the most famous ghost at this place is called the lady in green. This was created. I don't know how big it is. I've never been there obviously, but it says that um it took thousands of men to build this hotel back in the early 1900s. And they believe that the lady in green was the wife of one of these men. Um I haven't found anything where they even can put a name to her. So she is most often seen in that Hall of Mirrors. So here's my first thought. Remember when we were kids, you'd go to a fun house and you'd go into like the the mirror place and you'd walk in and you see like 99 reflections of yourself. All I can picture is this hall of mirrors and this lady in green and all of a sudden you see 8 million lady in greens. >> Well, we already know that mirrors are portals. Particularly if you put them facing each other. So if you have a whole hall of mirrors, what were they thinking? They were basically inviting ghosts. >> Pretty much. Pretty much. >> Okay. So they have this gorgeous hall of mirrors and so the lady in green is most often seen there but she also likes to ride the elevator. There was actually an employee who was on the elevator. A lady in green dress got on the elevator. They made small talk. He chatted with her and he turned to look and make sure he pushed the button and when he looked back she was gone. Doors didn't open. >> Classic lady in white/green. Ah, >> she's not in white, Ila. She's in green. >> Still the classic lady in white trope. I love it. >> There was another uh guest that was in the elevator and while the elevator was moving floors, um all they could hear was blood curdling screams when the doors opened. Um the person ran out and said, "A woman in green, it appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared again." She likes to ask for help. Um she will just say, "Excuse me, can you help me?" That's it. >> This is so good. This is classic lady in white. I love it. >> Ila. >> Yeah. >> Did you not hear me? I said lady in green. >> I know. Doesn't matter. >> Green. >> So good. All right. So, what's the real story? Tell me more. >> That is the real story. What do you mean what's the real story? >> Who was the lady in green? How did she die? Like, you said that she was someone's wife. Did they say how she died? >> No, they they're not even sure she's someone's wife. They're guessing. Hey witches, future Ila here. This story really intrigued me, so I reached out to find out more about the lady in green of the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza. I discovered that she does indeed have a classic lady in white backstory, despite her fashionable green dress. When the hotel was being built in 1930, her husband was a construction worker. The couple was hardworking but poor and she had saved up to buy a beautiful green dress for a worker appreciation party. On the night of the party, she got all dressed up, ready to go meet her husband for a night of dancing and drinking in celebration of the hotel, only to find out when she got there that her husband had died that day while working on construction for the Hall of Mirrors. It's said that it's her ghost that wears that beautiful green dress and spends her nights restlessly searching for her beloved husband in the mirrors and the elevators of the hotel and asking the people that she sees for help. When the hotel was renovated in 1983, her ghost became even more active. Many of the construction workers of that time had tales of seeing and even talking to the lady in green future out. Because very often in these lady in white slashgreen stories, there's usually a real historical event like you can trace it back to something that very closely resembles or resembles exactly the origin story of the ghost. So this lady in green possibly being the wife of someone who worked there, I wonder if the story goes that she died before it was completed or something like that. >> I could not find an origin story for her. That was the kicker. And it sounds like they're just assuming that she just happened to be the wife of one of the people associated with its build. And again, this wasn't even stated clearly. It could be because the style of her dress. I'm not sure. She could have been maybe an early customer that stayed there when it first opened in the 30s and maybe died there. Like they don't I could create a backstory, but >> So your lady in green doesn't exactly follow the lady in white mythos. That's cuz she's in green, Ila. >> I know. There you go. That's That must be why. So, there are a few characteristics that are the same. One of the cool things, much like my lady in white story, your lady in green involves liinal spaces. And and I'll explain. In America, the lady in white story. Okay. So, the lady in white mythos involves a young woman, typically young, beautiful woman, usually a bride or a young mother or someone who's engaged or love struck very often. Yes. Wearing a dress, a party dress, a white wedding dress, um an engagement gown, something usually beautiful that evokes happiness, youth, innocence, that kind of thing. They then usually die tragically, typically near water. And in America, they very often die near a road or a boat. And I think that has a lot to do with with America. You know, we were big on the roads and travel and particularly in the 30s, early 1900s when a lot of these ghost stories happened, roads cars were becoming a thing. >> That's right. It was very, very new. This was the new liinal space, the new magic conveyance that could take you from here to there. Roads, crossroads are liinal spaces. Waterways, crossroads along a waterway are liinal spaces. Elevators that take you between floors are liinal spaces. >> I didn't even think of that. >> Yeah. So, she very much follows some some of the very similar tropes. Now, the other thing that these lady and white/ lady and green stories have in common is that she's seen near her place of death. So, we're assuming she died somewhere near the hotel. But, they talk. These women that are either hitchhikers or walking along a place, they talk. >> They're seeking something. They're seeking an answer to a question. She's asking for help. >> Help or asking for home. They usually are asking for a way to get home or they're asking for help. And they will make small talk, which is something that differentiates them from other types of hauntings. So, she matches not in all ways, but in a lot of different ways. >> Whatever. Whatever. So, if you have any info, again to our Cincinnati, Ohio folks on the origin story of The Lady in Green, I need to know so that I can prove to Ila that the lady in green is not the lady in white. >> So much similar. >> But it was funny because I I chose Cincinnati as a place to do a little deep dive in. And there's a lot of haunted places there. Like, who freaking knew? >> It's wild. I'm telling you, someday when we get our van or our schoolie together and we travel around the country, >> we're ghost hunting for a little bit. >> We're ghost hunting. We'll go to all these supernatural >> with a Ouija board >> spots. Oh, with a few Ouija boards. So, I do have a lady in white story and lady and whites fascinate me because you find them everywhere. >> Now, where's this lady in white from? What's what state are we going to? This particular lady, white, she's from near Chicago, Illinois. >> You literally picked the same part of the country as me. >> I did. I did. I did. I did. She is called Resurrection Mary, and she's famous because a lot of people have seen her. She's been on Unsolved Mysteries. People have ghost hunted for her. >> I feel like I've heard it. I can't recall the story, but I feel like Resurrection Mary is familiar to me. >> I believe there's even a movie made about her. First, I'm going to explain a little bit about ladies in white and then we'll tell you about Resurrection Mary. So, they fascinate me because you can find them everywhere. Every single state, every city in America has a lady in white story. There's some folklore involving a hitchhiking lady in white. You'll also find them all over the world. Other countries have Lady and White stories that follow the same type of pattern as well. This archetype is deeply embedded in our subconscious for whatever reason, >> unless they're the lady in green, but go on. >> That's right. They're usually young women who died in distress. Their stories involve heartbreak, lost loves, abandonment, betrayal, unrequited love, that type of thing. And they're usually tethered to a specific place. And people will see them wandering near that place. Usually, it's a lake or road. They're usually asking either for help because their boat crashed or they're trying to get back to their friends and they don't know what dock they're on or they're trying to get home and they need a ride to get home from somewhere. Now in other countries it's usually a little different. They're not usually looking for a ride. Like for example, you have Laorona from Mexican folklore. She was a woman who was betrayed by her husband and she killed her children in a fit of madness and then committed suicide once she realized what she had done. So there's a lot of tragedy and heartbreak around these ladies in white, these ghosts, no matter where they're from. In Japan, you have the Enreo, which I think um the ring, like that ghost story, the ring. >> Yep. >> Was similar to that. In Slavic mythology, you have the Rousulka, which is another type of ghost that gets revenge. Not happy ghosts. None of these are very happy ghosts. In America, the lady in white is entwined with the vanishing hitchhiker story. So, here we have Resurrection Mary. And the first story that I heard of involves a young man named Daniel. So, he's driving along Archer Road in Chicago around 3:00 a.m. in October. It's eerie. It's cold. And this road is desolate. Old shops and buildings, closed dance halls, shuttered bars, that kind of thing. And his phone's dead. So, he's listening to the radio. The only station that comes in is mostly static, but he can hear a little bit of rock music in the background, so he's good. >> We've all done it, >> right? So, as he's driving, suddenly the radio comes in crystal clear, and it surprises him. So, he looks down at the radio, and when he looks back up, there's a woman who wasn't there before, standing in the glow of a street light. And he thought that she looked out of place because she's wearing a white dress and white shoes, and it's wet and cold and windy outside. and thinks that she's almost glowing in the light of the street light as most ghosts do. >> Exactly. So, he swerves to miss her and stops. And of course, she's right at the window as soon as he stops. And she is pale, blonde, white as a ghost, literally. And he asks if she needs a ride because he's feeling sorry for this young woman. And she nods silently and gets in the back seat. He looks in the mirror and asks her where she's going. And all she does is whisper home. and points down the road straight down Archer in the direction that he'd been going. So, he just drives along and he keeps checking on her in the rearview mirror and he sees that she's crying and looking out the side window. So, he decides to just keep going and figures she'll tell him to stop when she's ready and he's listening to songs music on the radio. Keeps glancing at her in the rear view. And he's just about to ask her where exactly she's going when the static comes back on the radio. And again, he looks down in surprise. And when he looks back up, and glances in the rear view, back seat's empty. So, he slams on the brakes, pulls over in front of some raw iron fencing, and there's nothing. Nobody. Nobody around, nobody in the car. >> I love it. >> He opens up the back seat and much like you and the baby bonnet, there's a white ribbon in the back seat and nothing else. He's parked in front of Resurrection Cemetery and there's no one around and he's just had an encounter with Resurrection Mary. This type of story has happened over and over again in that same stretch of road, Archer Road. This does have some real origin stories. The the original story says that she was a young woman in the late 20s, early 30s and was dancing at a a bar called the Oh Henry Ballroom down on Archer Avenue and got in a fight with her friends and with her boyfriend and was hitchhiking home when she was hit by a car and killed. >> Oh. >> And she had been wearing a very pale colored dress, 20s style, blonde hair, the whole thing. She's buried at Resurrection Cemetery, which is about a 30 minute drive southwest of Chicago, which is right along our drive. >> Was that Was that the home she was talking about? >> That's the home she's referring to. >> Oh my god. >> Resurrection Mary is famous. She's even been on Unsolved Mysteries in the '9s. There was a young man named Jerry Pace, and he's the first person who supposedly saw her ghost. In 1986 on Unsolved Mysteries, he says that uh he was out with his friends and it was 1939 at a ballroom going dancing and they're out having a great time and he meets a woman, blonde, wearing a cute dress and all she wants to do is dance. She doesn't talk much. She just wants to dance. He thought that she looked a little old-fashioned, but you know, hey, cute girl just wants to dance. He's having a great time. He didn't ask any questions. What guy knows fashion anyway? So he found out that her name was Mary and that she lived on South Damon Avenue and so he knew about where she lived and he said when they were dancing he noticed that her hands were icy cold but he didn't think too much of it at the time. >> Buddy, she was dead. Just saying. >> His mom always said cold hands, warm heart. And so that's all he remembers really thinking. At the end of the night he offered her a ride home. She said, "Well, you can walk me." and they start walking down Archer Avenue. And he said, "Why would we walk this way? You You don't live here. You live up here where you told me." And she says, "No, I want to go down Archer Road." So he's like, "Okay, whatever." So they're walking and as they get to the cemetery, he's like, you know, "Hey, I'll walk you home. Where are you going?" And she says, "Where I'm going, you can't follow." And she turned towards the cemetery and then disappeared in front of his eyes. Talk about being ghosted on a date. >> Yeah. Exactly right. He was so enamored of this woman who literally ghosted him that he went to the address that she gave him and asked the woman who answered the door if her daughter Mary was home. She said she didn't have a daughter Mary, but he saw the pictures on the wall and said, "That's her." And she said, "That's my daughter. She died 5 years ago, struck by a car a month before her 21st birthday. >> This guy's probably [ __ ] himself. >> And he did. And he insisted for years. >> He had a date with Mary. >> That he had a date with Mary. Now, other people have seen her. A cab driver, Bill Geese, was quoted in a newspaper January 31st, 1979. 2 weeks before, in the middle of January, the blizzard of 79 dumped over 20 ines of snow in Chicago. The night before that happened, he dropped off a passenger and then picked up a young woman who was wearing a fancy white dress. And he said, quote, "Those new kind of disco type shoes, but no coat." And he remembered her because >> no coat, >> no coat, and it's about to be a blizzard. He says she was a looker, a blonde. I didn't have any ideas or like that. She was young enough to be my daughter, 21 tops. I asked her where she was going and she said she had to get home. I asked what was wrong, if she had car trouble or what, but she didn't really answer me. She was fuzzy. Maybe she'd had a couple of drinks or something or just was tired. I don't know. All she would say is, "The snow came early this year." And would just stare out the window. She demanded to be let out at a point on Archer Road. Nabi couldn't see anything but the cemetery. >> I want to go to Archer Road. He stopped where she asked him as he was looking around to ask her where she was going to go because there's no houses there. When he looked in the back seat, she was gone. But the car door never opened. He said, >> "I want to go to Archer Road." >> Other people have seen her. Sometimes people will say that they'll see her at dance clubs on Archer Road, and she'll ask for a ride home, but then disappear before they leave. Other people that pick her up as a hitchhiker on the road will say that she often leaves a white ribbon or a white piece of lace in the seat where she was. So, >> I want to go. >> I want to go. I want to go. >> Right. Pretty crazy. So, yeah, Resurrection Mary is so famous, people see her all the time on the road that they even made a movie about it. She's been researched and photographed. There's even a photograph from 1939 and you can clearly see the face of a woman and then it's all blurry white. >> That was a good Yeah. >> So very famous. But yeah, Lady and White tales do fascinate me. So of course you knew I was going to pick a Lady and White story. >> That's why when I saw that Lady and Green story, I couldn't resist. That's just so cool because they do follow such a common pattern of having a usually a kernel of truth uh some story that fits it and and just following such a clear formula and in America being tied up with a vanishing hitchhiker which has always that type of story has always fascinated me. >> Mine just says better fashion sense and picked green. >> That's right. Picked a very pretty color. You know, white just washes out a ghost. You know, rain gives you a little color, you know, gives a little life to the tree. >> Don't make you look so pale. >> Right. Exactly. >> So, that is it for my ghosty story, but I am excited to get ready for Halloween. I'm loving this time of year. I am loving working with Crystal City Circle and getting ready for our sin ritual. There's just so much going on. It's just a fantastic time. This is my first season working at a retail location in downtown Salem during haunted happenings. Holy moly, guacamole. Jeepers. I have probably seen 30,000 people in the last couple of weeks. >> It's like in-person Black Friday shopping every single day of October, right? >> It is. It is. But I have met people from literally all over the world and people are fabulous. I've met listeners. I've done selfies. We've had great chats. It is amazing. Which, by the way, if you do find me and you come to Salem, I swear I'm going to push you to buy something. It's what I do. >> Everybody needs to leave Salem with fun, good stuff. >> But sometimes you need to take a minute. The hustle and bustle is fun. everything we do this time of year, you know, the apple picking and going to the pumpkin farm and going to the cider mill, you know, that's all fun, but it's also almost like a planning. October almost feels like planning time. You know, it's you're getting ready to kind of hunker down for for the winter and it's almost like, all right, time to do shadow work again. Here we go. You know, t the season for shadow work, you know. So, it's kind of like I look at it as a time to kind of set yourself up for that introspection period, the last hurrah. >> Yeah, I like that you said it's planning. You know, I I mentioned that for Crystal City Circle, our our sound rituals coming up and one of the things that we're doing is carving intentions, carving our big vows, big plans into some candles that we'll be using during the ritual. Not so much like a New Year's resolution, >> like a to-do list >> a little bit. Yeah. Like a big one. Just one big thing that we vow to try to do for the year, you know, and and try to really make that important and make that big. So, I've been I've been working on kind of deciding what I want to do for that. Like you said, planning for the next year. What vow do I want to make for me for future Leila for the next year? What things do I want to to sacrifice or or sacrifice what no longer serves me like you were saying last episode? and getting ready for that has been pretty big. Trying to pay attention, I think, to the themes of the season and really incorporate them into my journaling and into my like everyday life. I guess >> I think it's it's a cross between that and I do find it I don't want to say easier because it's easy for me anyway, you know, anytime, not just now, but it's more conducive to kind of do that ancestor honoring that that ancestor connection that, you know, hey, thanks for covering my ass for the last 365 days. You know, hope we do it again this next year. But, you know, kind of that where you take a moment of thanks or reflection like the thanksgiving for your ghosty spirits. >> Yeah. We've talked before about the mute supper and that one of the things I like to do is set a place. I don't put food on it every night, but I do like to regularly set a place at my table to invite my beloved dead in to celebrate with us. And on sin night, I do like to put a few treats on there that I'll then put outside for the animals. I also find that in addition to ancestor work and things like that, I find that this is a divination time of year for me. I'm really drawn to pull out my cards. I I work with all my different tarot decks. I find that I'm tarot journaling more and really diving deep into different types of divination, different types of scrying, working with my pendulums. I just made a set of um dowsing rods that I've been working with that have been kind of cool. I I'm not quite sure how to use them for divination, but they've been great for finding energy spots on my land. So, that's kind of neat. But yeah, I really like divination in the dark half. >> All right, Ila, I am glad you're sitting down. I have a confession and you cannot tell anybody. >> Okay, I'll keep it a secret. Just us and a few thousand of our favorite friends. Go ahead. >> Shh, don't tell. I'm kind of getting into oracles. Wait, oracle decks? Hold. Oh, I said that loud. Did Did you say you like oracle decks? >> I didn't I I said I'm getting into We We We aren't going to go so far to use any L-words here. >> Was your gateway drug the Sin Oracle from Secrets of the Witch? >> Honestly, you know that I've always loved that goddess oracle that I've had for 100 years. >> Yeah. But that always was like the exception. I mean, that's goddesses. It's different, >> right? Right. Right. So, I was at the store and you know, we're in the midst of our our season of the witch oracle for sawin sweep stakes contest, whatever you want to call it. And I was like, you know, maybe I should get one of those for me. You know, I I'll just try it. I'm I'm not going to like it, but I might like the pictures. What the hell? And I opened it up and I was like, "Hey now. Hey now. Ooh, hey now. >> It's good. It It It's good. It's good. Damn it. And I was actually kind of mad at how good it was. >> But yeah, that's just between you and I. Don't tell anybody. >> We won't all of our listeners, they're they're going to keep that secret for you. I know they will. >> Just in our little circle, our wiki circle. >> So, the other thing I'm working on, which has been a lot of fun, actually, is two meditations. The spirit meditation and also the crystal countdown meditation. And man, I've been really digging it. I've been having a great time. Probably the crystal countdown meditation will be the first one that will come out. I've been rereading the Power of the Witch, which is where I originally learned it. And I've been doing my own version of the Crystal Countdown for so long that when I reread Power of the Witch, mine is very different than Lorie Cavitts. So, I took the original idea from her, but then I I went in a >> in a Lea direction. I I embellished it in a Leila direction and I I really love it. So, I'm very excited to be able to share that with everybody and and to kind of revisit my roots a little bit and read that book because that was one of the first books that made me realize that what I believed was paganism was witchcraft and was pretty awesome. So, it's been a lot that's been a lot of fun >> and that's why anybody says what book should I start with Power of the Witch Lori Kat I don't know what else to tell you. Got nothing for you. >> And it still stands up. Granted, I haven't reread the whole thing, but I'm reading quite a bit of it. And so far, what I'm reading still stands up today. So, that's pretty impressive. And, you know, this is a great time of year to read. So, I am tackling my to be read pile is starting to get smaller. I'm really excited. But, we're also very lucky. Coming up, Shell, we have some authors, some wonderful witches, some very cool, magical people that we have been delighted to meet that are coming on the show. is the season for guests. >> It is. And for lots and lots of books to read. So, yay. Also, we have a list of haunted places to go. So, the next time you're feeling like [ __ ] around and finding out, shell, I have a few haunted places that we could go ghost hunting at. >> I I I think we need to do this. Yes, we need to take Ouija boards, a couple tarot decks, and your dowsing rods, and off we go. >> All the things. So, thank you everybody who has sent us some haunted location suggestions. Keep them coming because we really are making a list and I'm hopeful that next year we'll be able to stop at at least one or three or 10 of them. >> All >> of them. That's right. If Shell has her way, it will be all of them. >> All of them. >> And I am starting to collect some old Ouija boards. So, I have all sorts of cool things that we could try out. >> Seriously, people, if you have Ouija boards that you want to dump off on people, we will take them. PO Box Salem, Massachusetts 01970. Send them to us. >> Send them to us. The more haunted, the better. I have a couple now. I think I have three now from the old Salem, Massachusetts boards. And the prize of my current spirit board collection is the Ouija Queen that I just got from 1942. >> I only have one board that was made in Salem, so I'm jealous cuz you have three. Damn you. Someday we will have a studio together and all of these will be up on the wall. >> I'm manifesting that [ __ ] right now. >> Me too. I'm manifesting that [ __ ] so hard. All right. Thank you all.

----------------------------------------
Welcome to Back on the Broomstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimmooire, where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots after a long period of mundanity. >> We're rewalking the path of the wise, and trying out all the latest spells, rituals, and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices. >> So, grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron, and your crystals, >> and join us as we get back on the broomstick. Hi and welcome to Back on the Broomstick. I'm L I and this Sin episode, we're talking about embracing the shadow sides of ourselves. The dark half of the year is the perfect time to reclaim the parts of us that aren't pretty and don't fit into neat little boxes. If you were ever taught or felt that you had to stifle your righteous rage, quiet your emotions because they were too much, or make yourself smaller in any way, then embracing your shadow can be healing, too. And at the end of this episode, we'll give you a spell calling on the deities of the dark to wield that righteous anger. >> And I'm Shell. And you know, this some people think that this type of shadow work is scary and and unsettling and and something to be leerary of. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Shadow work can be deep. It can be hard. It can be scary. But out of all of those things, it is 110% necessary. So, let's talk about some righteous rage. And a lot of people think that shadow work is about healing trauma, healing your pain. And it is. It's about coming to terms with those parts of yourself that are hurt, that are damaged, or maybe that you don't like. >> There's other facets of it, too. >> Yeah. Part of shadow work can be claiming that shadow. That can be owning those parts of us that maybe you were told were too much but aren't really. >> You know, sometimes you are going to find yourself in raging situations. We all do. It doesn't mean you want to be in a rage, but you are. And you have to kind of learn how to flow through that, maneuver through that. Use that rage in a productive manner and find what you can glean from that rage and glean from the goddesses of rage. Yes, absolutely. Working with dark goddesses absolutely helped me to embrace that rage and to not shy away from it. And I think that this time of year, sin, the third harvest, this is the witch's new year. What better time to embrace that dark than the dark half of the year? >> I got a question for you. >> Sure. Wouldn't it be more fun to do shadow work in like March during the spring equinox where you're not so down in the dumps? I feel like you're doing shadow work when you can't really go outside anymore. It's getting cold. It's getting dreary. Doesn't that just kind of play into the angry part? Why don't what I I would think for me I would quell my my angry side with warm sunny days. >> Yeah, summer probably would be a better time to do that. But we're not talking about softening that anger. We're talking about actually embracing the anger. Sometimes anger and being pissed off is the place that you should be in. So maybe coming to terms with the dark and the dark half of the year is part of embracing that. You don't have to be afraid of the dark. The dark doesn't have to be looked at as bad or scary or making your anger worse. Sometimes the dark can be healing and comforting and help you to sort through why you're angry because maybe you have every reason to be angry. Sometimes you go out into the woods into the wet, rainy, dark weather and you know, maybe it matches your mood and you're just kind of walking out there with it and and feeling nature mirroring how you're feeling. I'm not sure. A lot of us like Halloween, right? A a lot of us decorate our houses for Halloween or witchy all year round because we find solace in that. We find kinship maybe in the dark. >> That could be it could be the the the thin veil. You know, you feel that you have that connection um with your ancestors, with your spirit guides that can kind of maybe better help you with that thin veil to to work through that anger, that rage, some of those feelings, some of those obstacles. So, it could be a veil thinning thing where you have your people with you, everybody's around you helping you. >> Feels almost easier to embrace this time of year, I guess. And I'm glad you brought up the summer because we as humans and as witches, as magical people, we know that who we are is made up of dark and light, right? If you want to use that type of analogy, we're we're shadow and sun, I guess, in some ratio. Right. >> Right. Right. And as witches, as magical practitioners, I think that sometimes we lean too heavily into one or the other. >> Maybe because it's the trend, maybe because it's what's cool at the moment. >> Maybe you don't have enough light or or maybe you're too nice when you should be angry. Me finding that balance, witches should be comfortable on both sides of that spectrum, I think. >> Oh my god, I just realized something. I've always been the shadow. You've always been the light. No wonder we're so good together. >> Very good point. That's true. You've always been the hikate to my Keredwin. And like you, Hkate is anger. She's the avenger. She brings justice. And her anger is righteous and purposeful, but she's also the guider of souls. She will walk you with her torch to the underworld. And that's kindness right there. And Keredwin, she's the mother. She's got the cauldron, the awen, the power of magic, but she chased Guan down and did not let him go because she felt that he betrayed her by drinking the potion she had made for her son. So, just like those goddesses, there's light and dark in everything and in everyone. And just because someone on the surface seems like they're angry all the time, doesn't mean that inside they might not be one of the nicest people, you know. And just because someone is smiling on the outside doesn't mean that they won't wrap up some righteous fury and smack you upside the head with it. But yeah. Yeah, I guess that kind of works. And back when we were searching and we were seeking and we were doing that year in a day with different goddesses, I found that as much as dark goddesses, as much as darker deities felt challenging. They felt like a lot of work. They felt like dealing with the angry people in my life that I didn't really want to deal with. They also felt very empowering. >> Right? A lot of these goddesses are painted in not so pretty lights. If you read some of the say stories about Baba Yaga, the folklore about the Slavic goddess, uh, folk character Baba Yaga, she's pretty chaotic and she's not always necessarily what you might call good. I've spent the last three decades being dedicated to Hikate, so you ain't telling me nothing. I don't know, sister. But if you've noticed, if you've noticed all this time, I've always been kind of drawn to those darker goddesses. You know, my my stint with Ple, the Morgan, Hakate. I've put a lot of work into dark goddesses over the years, and I'm not sure what the draw is, but I feel like I've always been drawn more to that that darker that >> pleasure and pain I like to call it. Like with Hkate, you know, she will embrace you and love you like a mother and she will whoop your ass like your grandma would, you know, I mean, like there's something about working with these dark goddesses that gives you an idea of where am I at and how how do I get to the next step and work through what I need to work through to get to that next step. You know, I would say sometimes the shadow work in the darker goddesses work on yourself. It's hard sometimes for people to to face these deities maybe because it is hard like you were just saying and sometimes it's because we don't like what we see. You know, we're told that say like take Lilith. Lilith is a good one. She's a demon. She's a demon from um ancient uh Judeaic Hebrew texts. She also some people think goes back to Mesopotamia, Sumeriia, Babylon. But in most of those stories, if not all of those stories, she's a demon. And in modern day, she's a goddess of feminine power. But her story goes back to the creation myth in the Bible. In writings called the alphabet of Ben Sarah, written in about 700 CE. Her story is that she was the first wife of Adam. Lilith was created the same time that their god created Adam from the dirt. They were both created as equals from the dirt. Whereas later, Adam's second wife is created from his rib so that she would be subservient to him. Lilith is created as his equal and he doesn't like that. And she didn't want to submit to him. So when he wanted her to act like a quote unquote traditional submissive woman, she said, "F you." Spoke the name of God and flew away to live her own life. But then she's vilified. She's a demon. She's a [ __ ] She sleeps around. She has demon babies. She kills children. She's jealous of women. She seduces men in the night. But some of that's probably conflated, right, with ideas of proper behavior or what is or isn't proper. >> Right. Right. Exaggerations. >> If they're afraid of sexuality, a woman who claims her own sexuality and won't be submissive is scary. So that's why goddesses like Lilith, we're kind of re-evaluating those stories. We're looking at them with different more modern eyes, right? to kind of reclaim those darker parts of ourel I guess or quote unquote darker parts of oursel you know same with with Ple the Hawaiian goddess you know a lot of people look as Ple as a goddess of destruction and and of fire and mayhem but sometimes with destruction that can bring a new you know sometimes you need to burn away for regrowth and I think maybe that the biggest theme with some of these goddesses is is, you know, similar to the the burnaway thing with PL. You got to shed away all that is there, good, bad, and ugly, to get to where the real work is. >> That's like the theme of Sin, right? It's the death of everything. It's the death and then the rebirth. And that's absolutely what Ple is. She is that volcano, that destructive fire. But that's where you see the most fertile soil >> that gives way for new for rebirth. Yes, it gives way for rebirth. The destruction part is is the hard part, the scary part, the unknown. Because let's face it, as a as as humans, we are afraid of the unknown. It's that destruction. It's that that burning away that we're afraid of and sometimes forget the rebirth after it. You know, kind of like the phoenix and the fire. You know, you have to burn away to rise from the flames like the phoenix. >> And there's a lot to be learned from the stories of Baba Yaga. She teaches you that you don't have to make yourself smaller or sweeter or easier to deal with in order to be your full magical wise worthy amazing self. Your truth, who you are, no matter how weird or rough around the edges it is, is powerful. And Baba Yaga might be scary, but she's honorable. She honors those who show her respect, that are clever, that have that inner strength. you know, she has boundaries and she's not afraid to enforce them. And that's part of her lesson. Vasilisa, I think is her name. It's like the the Russian Cinderella. She's the young girl with a stepmother, two step sisters, and is tasked with impossible chores, right? But she's got this little magic doll, and she has to go out in the forest and get some fire from Baba Yaga. And Baba Yaga, she's this old woman, right? She looks very, very old, very, very skinny. and her house roams the forest on chicken legs and she's got this big huge stove inside her house and she's a cannibal. All her stories, she's usually like a supporting character which is also kind of mysterious. But anyway, when people find her, she usually gives them tasks and if they're polite and do the tasks, she'll help you. But if you're not polite, she'll eat you. So, >> sounds like me on a Tuesday, >> right? Pretty much. So, Vasilisa goes there and does the chores and and does good by Baba Yaga's standards. So, Baba Yaga gives her a skull that's glowing to be this light that she was supposed to go get. So, she brings it back to her house, takes the skull out, and it promptly burns her stepmother and her two steps sisters alive and burns down the whole house, leaving Vasilisa alive but alone. >> Well, it freed her from her from her desparing situation. >> Yeah. So there's Baba Yaga, right? She's very chaotic, >> drastic, >> drastic. She can be good, she can be evil, but she's usually pretty fair. But it's it's scary to confront these ideas, these big things like Ple's fire, Lilith's sexuality or anger, or Baba Yaga's exacting justice. Those can be hard to face, but there's good lessons there. >> You know, like Hakkate with the crossroads, sometimes you just need to make a choice, and sometimes we don't want to make choices, but here we are. or you got to make a choice. >> A lot of times it's easy to shy away from the darker parts of ourselves, even if it can be helpful. We don't want to be angry. We don't want to be scared. We don't want to feel these uncomfortable emotions. And sometimes working with these dark goddesses, even though like Hakate, they might kick your ass about it, they will also hold your hand and help you to grow that strength, to find that strength within you to move forward. But what I don't like is part of that shying away of that darkness is I I have to mention we were sent a goddess oracle deck not too long ago and I can't remember the name of it so they don't have to be shamed at the moment but I saw the depiction of Lilith as you know >> oh I remember you were angry you were angry >> I'm still angry about it I'm still kind of pissed about it now one of Lilith's qualities is sexuality she is unashamedly unabashed Ashley sexual. She is not, in any lore or legends I can find, in any way a sex kitten. >> A sex kitten. Lily. >> No. No. And this depiction of her had her in pink cutesy lingerie, blonde, laying back on pillows >> like Barbie in like a Barbie sex kitten pose. >> I feel like that's blasphemous. >> It really is. And and I have nothing wrong with blonde Barbies in sex kitten poses and pink lingerie, >> but that's not Lilith. >> Yeah, you shouldn't shy away from that. Baba Yaga is ugly. She's still a very cool, very powerful goddess. Lilith can be mean and cruel and also very sexual. That doesn't mean that she's a pink Barbie fluffy bunny. And and I don't think we should ignore these dark sides because that makes us ignore the dark sides in ourselves. And I I'm not saying you need to go eat people that don't do your chores properly like Baba Yaga, but it's okay to be mad at them if they don't do what they're supposed to. >> There's definitely a fine line between taking it and not taking it. And I think sometimes working with some of these darker goddesses gives you a better a better sense of when to take it and when to not take it. They definitely can help you find your voice. And and I think I got a little distracted earlier talking about, you know, my journey with dark deities, but you know, as someone who had a lot of trauma to work through, I've found very much that Lilith and her [ __ ] off attitude very much helped me to work through some of that. And and a lot like um when we talked to Ness Bosch in a recent episode, she spoke of uh people who had survived sexual abuse or sexual trauma very often get tattoos of Medusa, who like Lilith, not exactly a goddess, but has kind of become a goddess and is a symbol of feminine power and of overcoming these obstacles. I just think that this time of year with with sin approaching and kind of the that last harvest the the theme of having that connection with your ancestors. So yeah, working working with some of the darker aspects of the goddess is is a great thing, but I also think at this time of year you incorporate some ancestor work into that shadow work. Sometimes the people that know us best are the are the family that we've had that have come and gone, friends that we've had that come and gone. And it's almost like having a conversation with an old friend or having a conversation with your grandma that passed and being like, you know, hey grandma, how have I been [ __ ] off this year and what should I be doing to, you know, get back on track or I don't see any problems in my life that I need to work on. What do you think, Grandma? Another one too with the ancestors is not just what problems do I have to work on, but what am I okay to be angry about? What is it okay for me to be enraged about? Like maybe you want to reach out to your fifth great grandma and say, "I'm having trouble voicing standing up for myself at work. I need to tap into that rage that you felt when you were trying to start a homestead or, you know, break off from your abusive husband or whatever. I need to tap into some of that ancestral anger so that I can have the courage to stand up for myself, you know, and it's embracing that part of the shadow. Not just finding the parts of you that are broken and bad, but embracing the parts of you that other people might say is too much or too angry so that you've kind of stifled and calling on the strength of your ancestors to kind of help you mentally prepare yourself to get yourself through that working. you know, gather the army, you know, get get everybody standing shouldertoshoulder while you work through this. >> Yeah. And and this time of year, it's so easy to do. If you're in a meditation or or if you're doing a spell or if you're just journaling or a tarot pull for the day, reach out to your ancestors, ask them, you know, say, "Hey, I'm angry with a friend of mine. I'm having trouble with this relationship and I'm I'm not speaking my mind. I'm not speaking my truth in this particular situation." you know, you can ask them for the strength or for the words to be able to say that and that can help you kind of bolster your own emotions and and your own strength. Now, how would you suggest that someone who has never worked with a darker deity? How would you suggest they start that journey? I know with me, Hkate found me. I didn't find her. I I swear. Um I even tried to run and she chased me down. But what would be your top tip for someone who has not worked with one of these types of goddesses or or with one of these deities that would be a good first step? >> Well, first of all, approach with respect would be the first step and and that always involves education. So if there's a deity that you feel is reaching out to you or chasing you down or if there's just someone that you're interested in, if you if you feel like you want to work with Khali or Sekmet, you want to work with the dog or Karnunos or Anubis or Hades, Pphanie, you know, any of these dark deities, any deity for whatever reason, whether they're calling you, you're calling them, you're just interested, is research. Research as much as you can. Find knowledgeable authors on on the topic and read as much as you can from them. Check out their papers. Check out their workshops. Check out their books. Journal about it. Meditate about it. I know that UPG unverified personal notice is not necessarily something you should write a book about, but it's very valid for your own personal experiences. If you are say with when I first started working with Lilith, I started reading as much as I could and she's difficult to read on because a lot of the papers are very academic. They're very textbook. They're very thick. They're very difficult to get through and there's a lot of modern stuff that's very interesting. But reading all of it is really important. Learn about the culture, the people, the religion they came from. But I also at the same time started meditating and asking for her to talk to me. I know mugwart is not an herb that you can use, but mugwart is good for dreaming and it's also a good herb for working with your subconscious, working with dark deities, working with that that inner voice, that inner strength. If you don't have mugwart, you can use I like copal frankincense for working with spirits, something to open up your third eye. But meditate with it, write about it. Start writing down what you're feeling. If you feel like they said something to you, write it down. And yes, that's unverifiable personal noses, which is basically your own personal magical experiences with deity. And you should write those down because they can have a lot of meaning for you and they can they can definitely deepen and strengthen your working with that deity. Some people don't have don't have the choice but to just do you know the UPG because you know as you remember back in the day I mean to find a book about Hkate [ __ ] I might as well tried to get inside the pyramids myself like it wasn't happening there just wasn't a lot of books about Hkate I think when when kind of the the publishing books thing became popular in this genre people shied away from some of those darker deities ities. >> Oh, certainly the publishing company absolutely did. They were afraid of being labeled Satanists. >> Satanists. Yep. And it there was books like the book that's not called 10,000 goddesses. Um, and you know, it was books like that where you would just get little snippets on certain deity because that's all that you could find out there. But nowadays, thankfully, that tide has turned. Like in the little awesome shop I work at, you know, we've got five, six books about maybe seven books about Hikate. And 30 years ago, you wouldn't have found six, seven books about Hkate in a bookstore. And you know, the same can be said for for Khali and for Lilith. You know, there's still some of, you know, like you're not going to go find 150 books on Ple at your local pagan store, but I think it's it's coming around. It's coming around more so than it used to. the information is getting put out there in a more easily accessible way. >> I would say that it's actually done a complete 180 from the '9s because now everywhere you look, it's Hkate. Hkate is everyone's favorite goddess. You ask three witches, all three of them will say, "Yes, Hkate is my goddess." And Lilith is is rapidly becoming popular as well. So, I would say that it's like the rise of the dark deities right now. The rise of the dark goddesses because people are feeling that rage, >> embracing that energy. >> Yeah. And and when I'm talking about goddess energy and feminine power, that's in all of us. I don't just mean women. I mean that feminine energy rage, that goddess rage, that earth, moon, mother rage that everybody feels at some time or another. So, when I say that, don't think I'm just talking about women. I'm talking about all of us. I think that this is an important an important task for folks who have not really kind of embraced this side, this darker side that maybe your your homework for this sin season is find a dark goddess and do some research. Find how she relates to you. find those correlations between the the dark parts of yourself that you need to strengthen and the dark deity that matches that because it's not all about working through anger and working through a rage like you just said. Sometimes it's about strengthening basically strengthening our inner core when you're doing those weird exercises at your occupational therapist. You know, you're strengthening your core. Sometimes working with the darker goddesses strengthens your spiritual inner core. >> Absolutely. And it can strengthen your confidence. It can strengthen your ability to voice your complaints to to create boundaries. And sometimes you need to tap into that in order to have that strength to to do those things. And working with your rage doesn't always mean stifling it or turning it to happiness or joy. Sometimes it means wielding it properly. >> Exactly. Key words, wielding it properly. >> Right. And now have there been times in your life when you have uh reached for a dark goddess to help you not transform one of these dark emotions, but maybe to help you wield it properly. A lot of times, you know, sometimes I I tend to be a little on the we won't call it the angrier side, but maybe. Um, yeah, there's there's been plenty of times where with my kids, angry about somebody getting bullied, angry about the way someone was treated, and you you know, you can't just go out and be all angry with people. So, you have to kind of wield that rage. Hkate has gotten me through some mothering moments. I think it's interesting because for you, working with say Hkate helps you to temper that rage and make it more laser focused rather than wild and chaotic, >> right? And for me, working with Hikate helps me instead of stifling that wild chaotic rage and and holding it in and holding it back, she helps me to direct it where it's actually supposed to be directed and to accomplish what should be done. >> Exactly. Exactly. Where where my unwielded rage gets more laser focused. Exactly. So, it's accomplishing the same thing. You know, instead of yours being wild and chaotic and burning you and everything around you to the ground and mine being wild and chaotic and burning me to the ground, we are then able to direct it properly. >> Correct? >> That's one of the ways of looking at this whole dark season and working with the shadow self around sin. It's a time to celebrate those dark characteristics. Find out how they can work for you instead of against you. Think of your journey through the dark half of the year as a way to honor the dark half of yourself. The sensual, emotional, powerful witch within. Let go of the negative traits, the fear, the self-doubt, the criticisms that try to make you less than. Think of it like Anana going down into the darkness and and giving these things up. She was not giving those things up just to sacrifice them. She was shedding them to then reclaim her power. kind of like what you said at the beginning with ple, you know, that that destructive force is scary, but it it has creation at the end of it. You know, all of this has that same positive goal. See, you just said something that sparked a thought. You said giving things up as if you were giving up a big a bad habit. Definitely a good time of year to give things up, don't get me wrong, but I kind of look at it more as a not giving it up, but I think the cliche term right now is getting rid of what no longer serves me. You know, kind of just burning away the [ __ ] cutting the ties of all the [ __ ] of the year because again, you know, this this is the witch's new year. So, we got so many new years coming up in the next few months. But for the witch's new year, I look at this as kind of a reset of my energy, cutting all those ties around me. Like, say I was in a little circular tube, cutting all the ropes that have tied me for the year that no longer serve me. Shedding the [ __ ] And this is a good time of year to shed the [ __ ] And sometimes you need the goddess to kick you in the ass to shed the [ __ ] And sometimes you need that fire of anger to burn those cords away, to burn that [ __ ] away. And you need to embrace that, >> to cut those ties that you're done with for the year. >> I find when I'm able to direct that energy, and I'm able to find out why I'm angry, why I'm raging, and work through that, I can very often direct it to get something done. Maybe I'm mad at myself and I need to get a project done or whatever, but finding that path through is often much more productive. So sin, the whole holiday kind of mirrors that same idea. It's pphanany going down and the earth dying and and then she's transformed and comes back up in the spring. The whole season is saying that go down into the dark, be in the dark, be comfortable in the dark and find your own light and then come back up into the springtime. And I I love how the season itself is kind of mirroring that same personal inner work that you can do right now. >> Be comfortable with the work that needs to be done because you're doing it no matter what. >> You and I are not fans of the cold. We're not fans of the wet. >> You'd think we were born in Hawaii, >> right? I wish >> I wish. >> I do miss the desert. And I I had someone ask not too long ago, just side quick side tangent. I did have someone ask that hasn't listened to all of our episodes that doesn't realize that I lived in California, but you know, the desert is different being in that dry, hot space this time of year. I know the fall is not cold, but it it still gets dark earlier out there. It still gets chillier. Your surroundings, your land still change this time of year. So even though it's not necessarily as much leaves falling and cold snow and all of that that we have on the west coast, watch how it change. See how the dark changes the area where you live. And maybe that can be part of you exploring the dark part of you is is explore the dark season in your area. What does it look like on your land where your land spirits dwell? No matter where you live, or maybe especially if you live somewhere that doesn't exactly match the northern hemisphere, Western European version of the seasons. Maybe one of your magical workings for the next wheel of the year from sin to sin could be keeping track of of what each season brings to your land. How does sin look where you live? What do Ule and Imbulk look like? What does the increasing dark or daylight feel like in your area? How does the changing seasons that you see around you affect your magic? What's growing in your area? What's dying? How is nature reacting in that season? How do you react in that season? Keep track of every tick of the wheel. And now after a year, you have a very personal, very powerful connection to your land, to your season, to the energies and the spirits that are around you right now. The magic that resides in that season where you dwell. Just quick side note on that one. So it doesn't look the same for everybody and it doesn't look the same where we all live. Are there any things that you'd like to do for sin to honor the dark in your area or to honor the darkness within yourself? I like to spend my sin ritual time doing a lot of ancestor work. My ancestor altar is in process of being finished and and put together. But I think this is always a good time to connect with my ancestors and kind of be like, "All right, you saw how the last year went. What do we change?" It's almost like asking I feel like it's asking the people who are going to tell me the most truth on what I need to do. So, it's a good I I find this a good time to kind of reflect with my ancestors on what do they think I need to shed away? What do they think I need to work on? What do they think my next phase should be in the coming year? So, I do kind of rely this time of year a little bit more on the ancestor work as opposed to the hkate work because I kind of feel like she's hounded my ass about this all year long. So, this time I kind of do the the ancestor approach. >> What does that look like when you redo your altar? Is that when you're doing that work? >> It's honestly it's almost like I sit down and have a conversation with my grandfather and he's like >> more of like a meditation. I would say maybe more like a meditation. You know, I'm not the greatest journaler, so that's not the direction I ever take it usually, unless it's tarot, but it's like having these conversations with my ancestors. And yeah, I guess using the altar is a conduit for that. Yeah. But it's having having these conversations and I guess a meditative state of where do you think I'm at? Where do you what do you think I need to shed away? What do you think I need to burn away? What do you think? I've I've let lack in my boundaries and kind of get my ancestors perspective. But I think that's sometimes because I've never trusted my own perspective. So, I almost feel like I need that affirmation from my ancestors to kind of remind me that I am doing all the right things, getting rid of, shedding these things from my life or working on these aspects that I've maybe ignored or need to work on or need to delve into or have hid from or are scared of. Sometimes you can take that, swallow that pill a little easier if it's coming from an ancestor. >> I also like to redo my ancestor altar this time of year. I'm a very basic ancestor alter [ __ ] I guess this is very easy to do this time of year. It's just easy to remember. So, that helps. I've set it up on a on a high shelf. I actually completely rechanged where it goes. But this year, the other thing I'm doing to connect with my ancestors and kind of like you, this year, I'm asking them for more help to access my voice and access my anger in healthy, productive, outward ways and not inward destructive ways. So, what I've done this year is starting on Mabin, I picked a time. I recommend that it be sometime between 600 7 o'clock. And the reason is because every night or okay, let's be honest, almost every night. So every night at the same time, I've been doing a very short meditation and a very short journaling, talking to my ancestors and giving them space, basically reaching out to them, waiting for 10, 13 minutes, and just journaling my impressions and saying thank you. But the reason I picked that time is because the days are getting shorter. At around that time, you can start to see it's darker. Every time you sit down to do that meditation at the exact same time, it's going to be a little bit darker. And especially this month, I'm noticing it really big. Like, it's really dark now when I'm doing this meditation. And when I started, it was bright daylight. And so that change in light of doing this exercise of reaching out to my ancestors at now it's sunset, but right around sunset. And watching that light change as I reach to them every day has been very very helpful. It's been very meditative. Kind of helped me to get into that I'm going inward. I'm going backwards. I'm going back to the dark. I'm going back to my ancestors. I'm going down to those roots. And so just kind of visually seeing that light change as I've been doing these just, you know, quick short little meditations each day has been a very nice way for me to connect with ancestors. And I found that I feel like I've gotten more energy and messages from people that aren't on my ancestor altar, you know, if that makes sense. Like unnamed ancestors that I don't necessarily know are coming to say hello when I've been doing this practice. So that's been that's been very interesting for me. >> I like that angle because I kind of do it more pointed to the ancestors I know, but I like your angle of and then and then you're able to tap into the ancestors you don't know. I love that. I have my known ancestor altar which I absolutely love. So I cleaned that off and I'm redoing that. But this I just kind of let it be free form and that's just kind of how it it ended up being and I'm I'm enjoying it. It's nice. Again, pick a time right around 600 7 o'clock somewhere in there so that as the time goes on you can see the light start to change. >> Shell's future self is going to do that next min. >> You don't have to wait to start it next maven. You can still do it now. I I just like the idea of a practice from Mabin to sin to honor my ancestors, but you can start it whenever you like and do it for however long you want. But yeah, great time of year to go within and and you know, with everything that's going on right now, I think calling to these angry gods, these darker deities that give you permission and strength and maybe a little wisdom to wield that rage is important because I I think stifling it or turning it inward is definitely not good, not healthy, not productive. And you know from a different perspective if you are maybe an overly ragedfilled person which I've had my moments this is a good time to learn how to kind of like you said laser focus that and instead of being destructive to everything and all kind of wielding that destruction into a positive good force um into into good change and not just some chaotic [ __ ] that you're trying to live through. So, you know, it's a good time to be in control of the rage you've got. And, you know, I I I get your your perspective, but from from people who may just be full of rage and just don't know how to properly release that, this is a good time to work on that and have your ancestors and those dark goddesses kind of guide you into being productive with your rage. >> I'm laughing because me and the people I'm talking about, we are full of rage. We're very full of rage. We just tend to turn it inward. We tend to turn it on ourselves rather than turn it outward. >> But you know the type of rage I'm talking about because you know sometimes me I tend to be rageful to everybody and everything within firing range. >> Oh yeah. Same rage. Just direct it out, not in. I get it. So everybody's got rage. It's just are you directing it inward or outward? Let's deal with this. >> Because working with these deities really can help you to do that. whichever whether you're Shell's direction or my direction. We have these feelings and and they're not wrong. Your emotions are your emotions. Having them is not a problem. >> It's how you deal with them. >> Yes. Dealing with them is the important part. And working with these goddesses who are unapologetically angry and some of them are unapologetically do shitty things. I I'm not going to I'm not going to lie. Like working with them doesn't mean you need to do shitty things, too. But it does help to look at these stories, to read these stories, to look at them from lots of different angles. Why were they that angry? You know, what can I glean from this? What can I learn about this? >> What lessons are here for me? >> Yeah. And what healthy ways can I express this rage? By shying away from the parts that we don't like, we're denying ourselves the chance to learn from them. We shouldn't shy away from those ugly parts. >> Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Because you know sometimes it's the ugly parts like you said you you actually described Baba Yaga as ugly. You know sometimes we are equal ugly and it's okay. It's okay. >> Exactly. Sometimes Hikate is the young strong new bio woman. Sometimes she is the crone with the bent back and the gray hair. All of it is okay and all of it is good. And I think that by shying away from the bones, shying away from the skeleton goddesses, shying away from the kiliac with her wild hair and her haggarded face, these are important deities that have a lot to teach us. And >> shying away isn't healthy either. >> No, not at all. You know, and maybe fully embracing it isn't really healthy either. >> True. True. Find the balance. >> Find the balance. Exactly. Find all the balance in these things. All right. All right. So, we mentioned at the beginning that we were going to give you a spell to help work with the dark gods and goddesses of the season to help you channel that righteous rage or anger that you might be feeling in a positive direction. So, we will have this on our website back onthebroomstick.com in the grimoire section here in the next few days. But the short version is you can do this on sin or anytime really. You're going to want two candles, a black and a red candle. Black for banishing, for embracing your shadows, a red candle for action, for fire, for that anger, bowl of water, and a mirror. And as usual, a journal or a pen. And maybe do a little research. Choose a deity. Maybe the Morgan, Hkate, Sekmet, Lilith, Arashag, Hades, Hell, Centa, Muerta. Choose who speaks to you in your blood and your bones. Choose who calls to you. The purpose of this spell is going to be to honor the dark deity within and to have them help you channel anger or rage towards a plan towards using it effectively. For this spell, you're going to create your sacred space. Cast a circle if you choose. Put the mirror in front of you and a candle on either side and place the bowl of water nearby. Light the black candle to honor death and transformation. Light the red candle to call in the fire of passion and change. Taking in three deep breaths to center yourself. And as you're breathing, start to really feel your emotion. Feel that anger, that rage, that passion. You know, don't let it consume you, but let it rise to the surface and start to feel it. Place one hand on your heart and really feel that emotion and start to call to that energy within you. Start to call to those deities that you have chosen. Say something like, "I call to those who walk the veil in crowns of bone and flame. Dark mothers, shadowed fathers. Come and witness. I call you to me. Teach me to wield what burns within me. Let my rage be righteous. Let my fire be clean. Let my hands do the work that must be done. Speak the names of the deities that you have chosen and give them a moment to speak to you. Feel that energy. While you're holding that space, gaze into the mirror. Look at yourself clearly and without judgment. While gently gazing into the mirror, say out loud the purpose of your working. Whether that's rage, whether that's anger, whatever emotion that is, whatever that truth is, say it out loud. Whatever you have silenced, speak it. Yell it, scream it, rage it, say it quietly, chant it. However you need to get it out, say it. Once all the words have come out, give yourself a moment. Take three cleansing breaths. And then gaze between the candles, not into the mirror, but at the flame, at the glow between the candles, directly to deity. Say, I offer you my fury, not to destroy, but to transform. This is the fire that clears away the rot. This is the roar that protects the child. This is the hand that breaks the chain. This is sacred rage, and I am its priestess. Dip your fingers in the water or oil. Use it to mark your third eye, your lips, and your chest above your heart. And say, "With water, I cool the burn, but I do not put out the fire. I carry it wisely. I use it well." Then focus that spell. Focus the energy that you raised and then tempered by writing it down. What it wants to do and then what it needs to do. Make a plan for using that emotion constructively. Whether it's protesting, speaking, writing, teaching, defending, creating, breaking patterns, breaking cycles, naming truths, ending something harmful, beginning something sacred, whatever that needs to be. Write down whatever your rage, your emotion wants you to do. And then write out what it needs to do. Just let it out as you're writing. Just let it go. Just whatever comes, let that torrent of emotion, let that torrent of words, let it go. And then as it cools, start to write your plan. Put it into words. And as you write that plan, picture all of that energy, all of the energy that you raised as you were speaking earlier. And also as you were writing, direct that energy to your plan, to your purpose with laser focus. When you are done writing, take three deep breaths and say, "I own the flame within me. I honor my truth by the will of the shadowed by the fire in my spirit." So won't it be? Close the spell. Put out the black candle in whatever way you choose with honor and reverence. Put out the red candle with strength and resolve. close your circle and make sure to eat, ground, and take care of yourself afterwards. And we'll put up a copy of this in full with all the details on the website back on broomstick.com. I I think that all this this talk is making me need to go have a conversation with a ancestors. I feel like I might have some rage. I need to focus. >> Oh, I know I do. This is definitely a ragefilled time of year. That's for sure. So, direct it properly. Don't let it burn you. Don't let it burn those you love. Work with it. And uh maybe find a goddess or a god that can help you channel those emotions rather than stifle them or let them get out of control. And don't look at this time of year as the heavy lifting time of year. Oh jeez, it's s I got a lot of work to do now. You know, all this all this shadow work. Don't look at it that way. I look at this as a time to shut away the [ __ ] and embrace new change for the new year to come. >> I hope you have a very blessed sin. Hopefully, it's not all darkness and scary things. Hopefully, it's reclaiming your power and embrace the dark gods and goddesses within you and be powerful in the shadows. >> Be that phoenix that rises from the ashes >> and keep it witchy.

----------------------------------------
Welcome to Back on the Broomstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimmooire, where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots after a long period of mundanity. >> We're rewalking the path of the wise, and trying out all the latest spells, rituals, and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices. >> So, grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron, and your crystals, >> and join us as we get back on the broomstick. Hi and welcome to Back on the Broomstick. I'm Laya and on this episode we're taking you down a spooky cemetery path. We were gifted an old Ouija board by a listener. Thank you, Vic. And these two witches decided to take it out for a spin. We're going to talk about our supernatural adventures in a well-known haunted cemetery. We'll also discuss cemetery etiquette, whether you're ghost hunting, gathering spell components, or developing a relationship with a permanent residence, as well as what you should and shouldn't do after leaving a place where spirits dwell. and I'm Shell. And I would like to mention that if you are also a fan of our previous podcast, The Stone Witches Hour, we actually did an episode on this particular cemetery, and it's one of my favorites. And I just I'm so glad that we get a chance to go back here and tell a new story. So, Leila, tell them where we're going. We're going to the Fall Brook Cemetery down in Tyogga County, Pennsylvania, which actually isn't too terribly far away from my house. This is the second time that Shell and I have gone ghost hunting in this cemetery. And let's just say that it didn't end exactly the way we wanted it to, but it was very interesting. Now, again, we did an episode on this on Stoned Witches Hour. Definitely go back and check that out. But kind of a quick recap, I came across this cemetery back in I don't know 1994, 1995. And a mutual friend of Leila's and mine actually went to college down there and going to this cemetery was so spooky it was a part of a hazing for a fraternity. >> Yeah, that's true. The local stories about this cemetery are numerous. Seems like anybody who was a teenager or young adult in the area at some time went to this abandoned cemetery because really creepy supernatural events seem to happen every single time someone goes there. >> Now, what the catch was for me was our mutual friend that took me to this place. You know, as Ila, as you know, this person is not I don't want to say they're not a believer. >> He's very serious and sciency. >> Yeah. very serious and sciency and wouldn't otherwise be a believer and said that this place made him a believer. So, at that point, I was like, "Let's do this." >> Anybody that goes here pretty much has a spooky supernatural experience. Ballbrook is a ghost town. It doesn't exist any longer. But back in the 1800s, a father and son duo, John and Duncan McGee, discovered coal, which is plentiful in Pennsylvania, right next to the Fbrook Creek. >> Coal in Pennsylvania? No way. >> Right. Really? So they established a coal mining company there. They constructed a railroad next to it like everybody did. And this was going up to Corning, New York, which is just over the border. And they transported coal up the railroad and the Eerie Canal. So it became a very big town and by 1862 there was 180 houses, a schoolhouse, boarding houses, shops, families and of course a cemetery. The population grew steadily but unfortunately the town had quite a few misfortunes I guess. Around 1872 it was at its biggest and people started dying of small pox. There was a small pox epidemic. There were several fires in the town. Eventually, the coal ran out and the town was abandoned. The town got overgrown. The houses fell down and only the cemetery remained pretty much. I don't believe there are even any buildings in the area left of the town. >> This whole area is now a part of the Tyogga State Forest. This is state land owned by the government. It's not like it's private property. >> It's all overgrown. And this cemetery itself is also very, very overgrown. A lot of the stones are falling down. They're from the mid to late 1800s. There are a couple from 1900 and I believe the latest one is like 1932, but they are in disrepair and the place is really spooky. So, we're going to talk about cemetery etiquette, what you can do in a cemetery. We're going to talk about ghost hunting in a cemetery. We're going to have a special guest on who was with us when we went to the cemetery and what he experienced both during and after. And we're also going to talk about a Ouija board that was gifted to us from a listener that we brought along to this cemetery. So Michelle, why don't you tell us about your personal experience at this cemetery when you first went here with our mutual friend and what happened? Because they should go listen to the Stone Witches Hour episode and I will link it in the show notes, but it's freaking creepy. So give them a short version of what happened to you. >> We're talking like 1994, 1995. My friend was actually still in college down in Mansfield. You know, one of those weekends, hey, you know, we did this thing and they say it's haunted. You should come down. At first I was like, yeah, everybody says that. But then I got this vibe that this was the real deal. And when you drive in, this is a place where you're kind of going down, I don't know, a mile or so on like a I don't want to say an abandoned dirt road, but an abandoned dirt road. >> Yeah. You're going deep into a state forest. >> You feel the vibe change. Or at least I did. You know, maybe it's just me and being sensitive, but like you can feel that you're going into something. >> That's a common thing that people that go to the area mention is that soon as you get close to the cemetery, it does have a vibe. And one thing I've noticed, you know, like I said, I've been there, I think, four times where you have to park. It reminds me of your house. It's almost like you're being watched. There's things in the woods watching you. But, you know, you walk up a path, you get there. But I think the most striking thing about when you first get there, the first time I went was at night, so it was even more quote unquote freaky and scary. This cemetery is almost kind of shaped in a circle, for lack of a better word. Kind of like you're in the middle of the trees in the woods and then there's an opening where the cemetery is and that opening is kind of in a circle. >> Just off the dirt road is a small clearing that's almost like a primitive parking lot. It's not >> like a pulloff almost. >> Yeah, it's like a little pulloff. And then just up the hill is the gate. You walk around the gate and there's a long path through the woods and then you literally come into a circular clearing with one guardian tree at the entrance and a big bush in the center and it there's graves everywhere and a few even extend into the trees but it does very much look like a circular clearing in the middle of the forest. But but what is striking about that and I know you noticed this too Ila the minute you get into that circular area the wind stops the birds stop the noise stops >> the crickets stop there's no insect noises >> but like there was wind in the woods when we were in the woods but then you go you get into the it's almost like dead air you know what I mean >> it is one of the anomalies of this area again this is one of the things that people mention all the time This is why college kids go there as a hazing because it's one of those places that's very weird. So you walk into this circular clearing and the noises of the woods and the natural noises of the fields fall away now. Back then it was a little more clear than it is nowadays. You know, we're talking 30 years ago. Some of the caskets are out of the ground. I remember walking and like tripping and I thought I tripped over a rock and I actually tripped over the corner of a casket. Now remember at the time I was like what 18, 19 years old. I was freaked out. I literally tripped over someone's casket. But then you hear the kids crying and I remember back then it was almost overwhelming. >> You mean the ghostly kids, right? >> The ghostly kids. Yeah. Because obviously it was just like a group of three or four of us there. We didn't bring kids with us, but like you could hear it. >> Yeah. One of the stories is that because smallox ran rampant through the town for 2 years between roughly 1870 and 1872, a lot of people died, especially children. And so this cemetery is infamous for having a lot of children's gravestones, young children. And a lot of the gifts people leave will be toys and candy and things like that on the children's graves. The lore says that when you go there, you'll either hear children laughing in the distance and possibly sometimes singing. They might be singing like nursery rhymes, but more often you'll hear children crying. >> So, to kind of fast forward, we get scared. We do whatever. We run to the car. All the car doors were open, the lights were on, and there was a baby bonnet in the front seat. That definitely was kind of a early 1900s type thing. No one was there. We all kind of stayed together as a group. It's not like someone, you know, went off and was playing a trick. I am not sure I've ever been so scared. >> And this is in the middle, literally miles into the middle of a state forest. There was no one else around that could have put that on there. >> Yeah. No. >> I love this part of the story. And when you and I went, I I believe we had one of these electrical anomalies happen as well. Another interesting thing that happens here, and people aren't sure if it's because of the cemetery or if the cemetery was placed here and it was already a strange place, but in this area, your battery will run out much more quickly than usual. Electronics die. They act weird. They pick up strange noises. They will suddenly have glitches. Flashlights will die. >> One time when I was there, we had a hard time getting the car started. Not being able to start the car is something that you will commonly see when people mention going to Fbrick Cemetery. They'll say, "The car wouldn't start when we got back out." And it happens repeatedly enough that I was worried when we went if our car would start when we came back out >> cuz there's nowhere to run. >> There isn't. We did have an experience in that parking lot on on the way out, but we'll get We'll get there. We'll get there. >> We'll get there. So, cemetery etiquette. Whatever cemetery you go to, you should always when you enter say hello or you should ask permission. You should talk to the guardian of the cemetery. You should make an offering or at least make an acknowledgement as you're walking in. >> Now, you make this sound so super formal and I love you for it, but I really kind of sometimes just do the hey, >> what's up? Okay, it did sound very formal and it can be especially if you're trying to make a relationship with the spirits in that cemetery or with the guardian of that cemetery. You should be formal, but here >> I was just visiting. >> There's a tree. >> Yeah. >> Is that tree would you say that that's where you made your kind of hey to the guardian is that tree when you first entered >> not the bush but the tree? >> Yeah, because that tree kind of seemed like like the entry point. >> It did. Right. Okay. So, when you first walk in, you walk in a little ways and there's a an older gnarly tree kind of in the center of the entrance of this circle, >> but you're like drawn to it like like a fly to freaking honey. >> 100%. Now, a guardian, a cemetery guardian. Every cemetery has one. >> It was totally that tree. >> In this particular case, it's that tree or the spirit is near that tree and it's very easy to feel. Shell and I both went immediately to that tree and in my head I said, "Hey, we're here. We're not planning on staying. Thank you so much for letting us be here." And just kind of a silent nod to the guardian of the of this cemetery in my head. >> Mine was more like, "We're okay. Are you okay? Cuz we're okay. You're okay." >> But in this tree, someone had left a Polaroid picture and all I could make out on it was an orb. I'm not sure what else was in the picture. >> You love your orbs. >> I do. Also, there was a blue bandana at the base of the tree as an offering. And this this cemetery is littered with offerings at the gravestones. This was the only tree that had offerings. >> It it very much definitely was a symbol, spiritual, man-made, I don't know, but it felt like you had to pay homage to it before you moved on. >> Agreed. Now, folklore says that when a cemetery or a graveyard was first created, the very first person buried in the cemetery, their soul would then be bound to look over all the souls that come into that cemetery. They become the guardian. >> No pressure, >> right? And so to kind of counteract that pressure, sometimes they would bury an animal. They'd sacrifice an animal and they bury it there to become the guardian. or take the body of a a poor person or someone whose family couldn't complain and they would bury them first. >> Resident number one, >> right? So, they would take somebody undesirable and bury them there first or they'd sacrifice an animal to be the sacrificial soul to be the guardian. Other people believe that the strongest soul there becomes the guardian. There's a lot of different folklore around it. So, you kind of have to check with your cemetery and see who you think might be the guardian. All I can say is energetically that tree >> where's the guardian >> is either the guardian or the guardian's buried underneath it or right near it or has chosen it. Anyway, that tree that's where you say hello to the cemetery for sure. So, bring an offering for the guardian. For us, I know we brought cannabis. I had a little bit of cornmeal left over from making labyrinths. So, it's always a good idea to bring something small, some type of offering to the cemetery or the guardian of the cemetery. Well, we brought some tools with us. We >> did. >> We did bring a oldfashioned tape recorder. Shout out to your husband for still owning one. We brought tarot cards, obviously. We brought a Ouija board. Now, first of all, again, Vic, thank you. You gave us your creepy Ouija board and we decided to [ __ ] around and find out. So, we brought it to Fbrook with us. Huge shout out to Vic. Thank you so much. Vic came up to us at the Central New York Pagan Pride and she gave us a Ouija board. >> I remember that no one wanted to touch it and her father demanded it get out of the house and we have it. >> Vic says this particular Ouija board was in like an attic room of their house for a very long time and none of the kids ever wanted to go in that room because they said that room was creepy. >> And didn't they say no one remembered how it got there? >> They didn't remember who brought it into the house or how it originally got there. just that it was there and at some point they know that the planchette to it disappeared. It had been there and then it just wasn't and no one used it. No one went in that room. She said it was like the plant just [ __ ] off. Like the house just absorbed it, disappeared it, took it away, whatever. Now, at this point, her father just recently said he wanted that board full of spirits out of the house. But no one would go upstairs to get it. So he decided he wanted it out so badly he stomped his ass up the stairs, got the Ouija board, gave it to her, and said, "Get it out of the house." And of course, she decided to give it to her favorite [ __ ] around and find out aunties us. Thank you. Cuz you know what? We're going to get to it in a minute. But it was a wonderful experience. But yeah, so we walked around. We were trying to record various things on our phones. We set the cassette tape up in a certain area a couple different times seeing if we could capture anything. But we all kind of had this vibe that we weren't alone 110%. A couple of times, you know, we we split up. You were off one way, I was off another way. We were being watched by not people. And that is another common story people will often talk about feeling like they're being watched. Like there's people in the woods just a few trees in watching them while they're in the cemetery. >> You know, and you got to remember not not only was this a cemetery, >> an abandoned town, you know, they talk about like in Gettysburg that that some of these soldiers, you know, think they're they're still alive and still on the battlefield and still fighting the war. I sometimes have wondered when I've been at Fbrook and having that sense of people in the woods, could there be people that died in the coal mines that don't know that they're dead and are just walking around their town? >> Could be. That was like a mile or so away from the cemetery. So, yeah, they could be. >> I want to mention, you know, you you wanted to mention the tree in the front. What about the tree in the back? Okay, so there's three trees kind of in a row that are all interesting. There's the guardian tree when you first walk in. Then roughly in the centerish, kind of off center towards the front is like a bush tree. And there are quite a few graves around this bush. A lot of graves around this bush. And then further back in the line on the back side of the circle is the white hanging tree. The front tree had kind of a guardian, welcome to my cemetery vibe. That tree in the back had a vibe of [ __ ] you, I'm going to get you. >> It's the only white tree in the area. So, it is very vivid, very stark, and very easy to see. >> Yeah. It also has one branch, a lower branch that kind of comes out at a right angle for a while and then goes straight up >> almost like it was purposefully bent that way when it was growing >> to be like a a hanging branch. So sometimes it's called the hanging tree >> and it does have a weird vibe and there are some graves near it and it does have carvings in it and that area is where our guest had a lot of concern about wild animals I think. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> One of the many things that people hear in this area again they feel this strange sense of being watched. they start to get nervous and antsy and feel like there's something in the woods that's going to come get them. Some people will also talk about hearing what they call a banshee scream. And I don't think it's a banshee and I have reasons, but go listen to the stoned witches hour and I explain it all in that. But people hear some type of screaming and there are a lot of people from Scotland that are buried here. People would come over from Scotland and they worked here in the mines. So it is possible that they brought some of their folklore which you know Appalachian region it all kind of follows anyways but yeah so people feel a lot of unease here and I'm pretty sure that that's what uh the other person that was with us felt as well. >> I would almost go so far to say extremely negative energy from that part of the cemetery. Absolutely. >> The tape recorder that you mentioned I set up in two different places. We first set it up um near that bush that I mentioned that had a lot of gravestones around it. It was kind of roughly in the centerish. We set it up near a young child's gravestone. Set it to record and then left it and went off in different parts of the cemetery to see what we could find. Then after what would you say like 20 minutes or so? >> Yeah. >> Turned it off and then I put it up by the white hanging tree up at the other end of the cemetery. Interestingly, we did catch some EVPs on the tape. The first one sounded like a military drumming. >> I could think it in my head like that. >> Exactly. And then it didn't record that military beat in the other location. I'm having a hard time getting it from tape to MP3, but I'll I'm working on it to make it nice and clear. But I will put up what I think are some EVPs that say a couple different words and we'll see what our listeners think. But it recorded the drumming in one area and not the other. Leila, I do want to mention you and I were unique in the fact that it does take a little bit to rattle us in this type of situation. True. the person that we had with us that we'll have um chat in a few minutes, maybe a little less so, but it it takes a little bit to rattle either you or I. And towards the end, I felt like there was something associated with that tree that was just pissed off. And not that it was pissed off at us, but you know how sometimes when you're the only one listening, >> like you said, a lot of the negative energy was concentrated up in that area. And you know, we were mostly around the sides and the center asking questions, trying to see what we could find. I really did feel like a lot of the eyes on me were also coming from behind that tree. But I want to quick jump to how you felt because sometimes you and I get a different vibe. How did you feel in that area and around a tree? When I first entered, I could definitely feel the energy of the guardian tree. That was one of the biggest places that I I felt activity. And and then once I got into the cemetery when we first walked in, I kind of walked to the left of the guardian tree >> and I went to the right. Yeah. >> Mostly what I felt was that just outside in the woods, feeling of being watched was very, very strong. We did go in the evening as it was getting towards sunset. But I think that when we were doing the Ouija board, that's when I started to feel that's really when I started to feel some energy and that's when I put my hood up actually on my hoodie because I was starting to feel a little vulnerable at that point. So that's when I put my hood up. Let me interject quick and say in that beginning when you immediately went off to the left and I immediately went off to the right, there was a grave kind of deep in the woods on the right in the front. The gravestone itself looked like a tree stump. When I was over there, maybe we're there 10 minutes, 15 minutes at that point, I already was hearing words and whispers and was I knew there was something there. And you and I grew up in the woods. You know, we grew up in in a rural area. We know the difference between is that a deer, a black bear, or a ghosty. And this definitely was not an animal. But I I was getting that the minute I separated from people. It was when I moved the tape recorder before we did the Ouija board. I moved the tape recorder to the far end of the cemetery over by that white tree. When I hit record, I had thought that either you or the other person had come up next to me because I I heard one of you say, "Is that where you're putting it?" And I looked over and neither of you were there. >> We weren't anywhere near you. >> No, you were both more towards the entrance. So, that kind of threw me a little bit. But that is also where again this other person had had some some negative vibes. So, I I wasn't too surprised. And that's where we did catch the most EVPs was up near that tree. >> We put the Ouija board, I don't want to say right where you were recording, but kind of where you had the recorder the first time, which I didn't even think about until like after the fact. I was like, "Oh, wow. We did that in the same spot." >> They do feel that's a very active area. >> There was something about that area that kind of I don't want to say made me feel sick, but kind of made me feel sick. After we were done, I did kind of want to get away from that area. But, you know, in true you and I fashion, we were like, "All right, somebody gave us a freaking weird Ouija board. Let's do this." This was just you and I. It wasn't the person with us. You and I are pretty good with the Ouija board. But I've got to say, my first, and this was the first thing I said to you the minute we were done. You know, normally when you use a Ouija board, sometimes, you know, you got a good flow and everything's like moving through air and, you know, woo, we're going all over here talking. This was like if you were trying to get through sludge. >> Yeah, I felt the same way. Yeah. >> Or if you were like waist deep in sand trying to walk. >> Yeah. The planchets trying to go over gravel or uneven ground or something. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> It did smooth out. We got an answer. It started to say a name and then it almost felt like a hand slammed down on the planchette. >> And you know, it was kind of funny because it started putting out letters and you know, stupid me. I'm going to yell out stuff. Some people are like, "Don't talk. Let it do not me." I knew it was going for William. I don't know why, but I knew it was going for William. And the minute I said it out loud and you and I had the same exact thought, I felt like whoever was trying to speak through that board was abruptly told, "Oh, no the [ __ ] you ain't. You ain't talking to them." >> The letter started spelling. And I also immediately heard William in my head. As soon as it was spelling the name and when you said it out loud, that's when I felt like somebody put their hand down. They're like, "No, you're done. You're not talking to them." >> Same thing. Now, other people have felt children hold their hand. People have heard names. >> You kept trying to shush us because you kept thinking off there to the left that you were hearing kids. >> Over in that one section where I felt like I could hear people. It felt like there were children playing almost like kids at recess sounds, laughing, playing. I was not able to catch any of that on video. I'm still going through some of the videos. So, if I if I find anything that sounds like it might be an EVP, I will put it up. But, we have a lot of video I'm still going through. So, we didn't catch a lot, but we did end up leaving. Now, before we get to the reason why we left, which happened shortly after our abruptly ended Ouija board session, was there anything that you brought with you to the cemetery? >> Me personally? >> Yeah, like protection wise or anything like that? >> Oh, yeah. You know, hey, my first rodeo. Um, especially at this joint, based on experiences I've had here in the past, I came with a salonite stick and I came with a black tormolene rock, which if if nothing else, if I hit somebody in the head the right way, I could have taken them out. >> Exactly. >> I always come with with my jewels. I wore a special one of my special pentacles. And then I brought two particular things with me that when I'm deal sometimes my theory is is when I'm dealing with ghosts, I like to have ghosts protect me. Makes sense, right? >> It does. It does. Ancestors are great for this. >> You're going to go deal with ghosts. Bring the posi. So, as you know, I I had a friend pass away, and before that, she had given me something, and I brought that with me. And I also brought something of my grandfather's cuz he's been like my ghosty BFF for years. And I had one in one pocket on one side and one in the other pocket on the other side, almost like in me in the middle, like, you know what I mean? >> Mhm. >> Yeah. So I had my salonite, my black tormolene, and my two things for my ghosty people. So this particular time, I brought an acorn with me to leave as an offering. I brought pine needles in my pockets because pine is an excellent protection. I also brought rosemary mixed in with the pine. Again, great protection against spirits. So I just have a few herbs in my pockets. I like that because the scent is very good for me. If I can smell a little rosemary and pine, that's very calming. As well as I know that these are an excellent protection and an excellent banishing component to spells. So by smelling that, that helps remind me, oh, you're the witch here, [ __ ] You can tell them to get the [ __ ] out anytime you want to. The power is right here. So just the smell of that helps to ground me and let me know that I'm in a safe place. So, I like the herbs, but leaving offerings on graves is another good idea. Plus, it it helps to leave things there. Never bring anything home with you from a cemetery. And I almost broke that rule, Shell. I picked up a couple of sticks and pine cones. They were so cute. >> I know, but no, not here. Not here. I picked up the pine cones and I was carrying them around the cemetery and I legit started walking towards the path with them in my hand when we were getting ready to leave. And as I got to the guardian tree, I'm like, "What the [ __ ] are you doing?" And I I left them at the guardian tree. I knew better. >> Thank you. Thank you. >> No matter how cool it is or how much you think you can cleanse it when you get home, don't bring anything back with you from the cemetery. You should not. >> I do want to mention that my traditional offering is weed. Okay, there I said it. It's important to me. It's important to spirit, you know. Hey, always got it with me. >> We did smoke a bowl and offer that to the spirits when we got there, too. >> Then there was the person that was with us. >> Yes. And we're going to introduce them. Listeners, say hello to Shell's true love, Sheamus. >> Hello. >> So, Sheamus came with us on our ghost hunting adventure. And Sheamus is not a witch. And are you skeptical of ghosts, Sheamus, or do you believe in ghosts? >> I don't believe in them. >> So, when you came to the cemetery, how did you feel when we were pulling up to it and walking up that path? Did you have any vibes, any feelings? Were you excited? >> Excited. Kind of cool to see. >> He's probably thinking, "What did my girlfriend get me into this time?" Seriously. >> So, when you first walked in, what was your first impression of the cemetery? What did you see? What did you feel? different different like a different type of cemetery cuz it was definitely um hard to describe. Unique I guess is the word. >> So when you went off to the to the far side of the cemetery up by the white tree, can you tell us what you felt? What you what it seemed like up there? >> I was looking around and then I was just like, "Oh, what do I hear?" And I'm deaf. So if you're hearing a noise in the woods, it's probably pretty loud, right? >> Yes, definitely. >> So you heard some noises off in the woods, >> like animal like steps, footsteps. >> Did you see anything? >> No, but I was drawn to like there was like an opening in the woods, I would say. I don't even think it would be a path. And I kept on looking through that just to see. Not seeing anything but hearing like and it could be wind. It could be multiple different things. I don't know. >> So, you're hearing footsteps and noises in the woods. The three of us are like at three very different very far away from each other pointing. >> None of us were close to each other really. >> I could hear Sheamus by that white tree exclaiming that there was something in the woods. I remember hearing you yell that there was something up there and you were hearing something in the woods. Now Shell, did you hear anything? Did you hear anything in the woods? >> I did, but not where he did. And I very much there was something there. I was being watched 110%. But us having a different perception, his mind immediately went to animals. Whereas you and I, you know, bored in the woods, we know if a deer hears and sees us, that motherfucker's running. If a bear hears or sees us, it's running. Um, they're more afraid of us than we are of them. So, I knew it wasn't an animal, but I also knew I was being watched by not a person either, cuz there was nothing there. >> What I thought was interesting is that Sheamus got more agitated and more concerned because the noises in the woods were were getting more apparent, right? Was it getting closer? Was it getting louder? >> Definitely circling, >> pacing. Yeah. >> And you heard the footsteps clearly. >> Yeah. Oh, yeah. It was definitely something was out there. >> Were you able to see anything? >> No. I wish I could. And >> now when I knew he was getting a little uncomfortable, I'm used to the woods. Kind of used to ghosts and I'm like, "All right, let me go check out and see what's up." I was not hearing what he was hearing where he was hearing it. Again, I was hearing stuff in the back corner, but when I went up to him, I just felt a lot of negiveness. That whole area by that tree, >> it just felt heavy and negative. And that that's really where he was. And I'm just I knew something was there. I knew it was not an animal, whereas he thought it was an animal. >> Yep. And it was after this that I moved the tape recorder up to that area. We brought Sheamus down with us to do the Ouija board in the lower part of the cemetery. But the unease that Sheamus felt continued to grow. And it as the darkness started to come down on this cemetery, we were all starting to feel extremely uneasy >> and it all was centering towards that tree. >> So I went back and picked up the tape recorder. As I was walking up to it, I heard it click. Stopped. >> Wait, was there still tape left on it? >> There was. >> Oh my god. >> It just stopped as I was walking up to it. There is a few things. Again, there's a couple things. I will play the recording. We did catch what sounds like drum beats. So, we'll play that. And there are a couple things that could possibly be EVPs. So, I will get those captured and put up as well so people can take a listen. But most of them happened up by that white tree. As we were leaving, here's what happened. We leave and Shell and I both stopped, said goodbye, and then walked forward, not looking back. As we got to the gate, I dropped my herbs as the last offering. Again, not looking back because you don't do that. Anytime you've done any type of working with spirits or in a cemetery, you riled them up. It's a good idea to not look back. Some people will even say you should cross over water. You should splash yourself with water or drink water. Some people say you should spin clockwise or counterclockwise three times as you leave. I was always taught don't look back. All of these practices come typically from folk magic. And the idea is to cut off any connection that the spirits of the cemetery have with you. So that way you don't end up with any spiritual hitchhikers coming to your house. >> And then there is my sweet darling love who is a non-believer. He again from the city not familiar with the woods did not trust a word Ila and I said he felt that for our safety he needed to look back continually cuz he really thought it was animals. Ila, you even said don't look back. >> I did. >> Did it help? No. We get to the car. Shell and I are in the front seats and at the same time we both look out the passenger window and then follow something to the right that moved quickly. I saw what looked like a white fox in the dark of the woods, maybe 15 ft, 20 ft off the side of the car, and then it ran away towards the rear of the car. Now you're in the passenger seat. I'm in the driver's seat. So I can see your head. You can't see my head or where I'm looking. >> Right. Cuz we looked to my right. >> Yeah. So we looked and I'm like, she's looking in the same place I am. And then when it moved, your head moved at the same time. So I knew you had seen it run. And I said, did you see that? And you kind of did. What did you see, Shell? >> I actually saw a black figure of a person. You saw >> a white. what I saw, but we saw it in the same spot at the same time. >> Do the same thing. >> And I did hear a scream and >> I just got chills all over again thinking about that. >> I don't know why you and I saw something different, but there was definitely something there because we both, for whatever reason, >> we looked in the same spot. It was standing there and then it ran off to our right and we both saw it, but we saw completely different things. >> I was going to say, but we saw two different things. So that that's wild. We make the drive back to my beautiful, wonderful, awesome, witchy little cottage on the top of the mountain in the woods that used to be a church. >> Do you think our cemetery story ends there? >> No. >> We wish. >> Yeah, we do. Now, Shell and Sheamus have had some experiences in my house before. Shell in particular. >> They watch me sleep in her house, people. and I've seen them and they're pretty calm as far as ghosts go. I hear crying, which is the worst thing on occasion. >> And all the all the times I've stayed at your house, I actually don't hear things. For me, especially when I was staying on your on your first floor, it was just like your deck was surrounded and they were all just watching me sleep through the window. But never bothersome, never loud, just being watched. So, it was cool. It wasn't that big of a deal. So, for some reason on the east side of the house where my bedroom is, that's where we hear the crying. On the south side of the house on the deck, they walk back and forth. And in the basement on the south side, there's a hallway there, and they walk up and down that basement hallway as well, but they don't really move things too terribly much. Just a little bit. They don't really do much. They're just kind of there. >> You and your ghosts have a have a agreement. >> Yeah, they're pretty chill. They're pretty mellow. They're very quiet ghosts. Except the night we got back from the cemetery. Why don't you guys tell us what happened? >> Okay. It was late. We were tired. We're like, we're going to go to bed. So, we were in in your upstairs and shut the door. Now, we had been at your house at this point for like what, four or five nights? >> Mhm. >> And we shut the door. We go to bed. Whatever. We shut the door. We lay down. Babe, tell them what happened. >> The door kept on opening. >> Had this happened in any of the other nights that you had stayed here? >> No. No. >> Not once. >> No. >> But you know, I mean, you have like freaking three cats and you know, I've had cats push my doors open and I thought to myself, no offense to my love, but you know, sometimes you ask someone to do something and I asked him to shut the door. Maybe he didn't pull it all the way. Whatever. Okay. I'm like, "You need to get up and shut the door." So, he gets up and shuts the door. 2 minutes later, door opens wide open again. I'm like, "All right, you want something done? Do it yourself." And I'm thinking, "Where's the cat?" "No cat." >> "Nope." >> I'm like, "All right, shut the door." I did it. I know it was latched. Good to go. Lay back down. Get cozy. Kiss good night. Door opens again, [ __ ] I'm like, "No, I know I latched it because I did it myself, so I know it was done right." So this time I'm like, "Oo, Leila has a lock on here. I'm going to lock it." I I I don't have words for you cuz that [ __ ] door opened. So finally I was like, "You know what? I'm going to do my little thing." I'm like, "All right, whatever is here, back off. We're trying to sleep our space, you know, kind of creating our our space. Don't. We go to bed. We're good. I did lock it again. I woke up in the morning. I woke up before him and the door was wide open. Now, my bedroom is a floor below that one. It's a very small room. So, on my door, I have some of those, you know, hangy things that you can hang stuff up on. I have a bunch of coats and sweaters and everything. It's a very heavy door. My door will swing open pretty easily, but to shut it kind of takes a little bit of effort. I usually leave the door open. There's nobody on the first floor. My dumb cats like to come in and out. So, leaving it open is less effort. I woke up the next morning and I walk out of my bedroom and I'm on the little landing in front of my door and I'm talking to my beloved. My door slammed shut. No cats nearby, no windows open. My doors never do that. The the doors in this house do not open and shut on their own. They just don't. But my door slammed shut that morning and I immediately said, "Sheamus, get your ass down here." >> And then I immediately felt guilty. >> That's right. But part of that was our fault. We probably should have followed some protocols when we got home. We should have smoke cleansed with some rosemary or some sage. We should have thrown some salt over the doorway. We could have thrown some water on the ground and stepped over it. But I was thinking, you and I know the protocols. We did all the right things when we left that cemetery. >> And we kept saying, "But we did everything except make sure that he did everything." >> That's right. And so we could have taken some even further secondary precautions and we didn't. But you guys unfortunately had to leave pretty quickly after that. So I was left to take care of the infestation on my own. I actually kind of bitched for like a day and a half. I'm like, "And then you brought a ghost back to Leila's house." It was hysterical. And and and he actually felt absolutely horrible. He was like torn between I don't believe any of this, but I feel bad because Leila thinks I did something to her house, so I need to apologize even though I don't believe it. Actually, it wasn't that difficult. My office in the basement is relatively central. So, I just did a very simple banishment and protection circle from there. uh smoked out the entire house between putting sage and rosemary and pine, a little bit of dragon's blood and some frankincense on my charcoal burner, and smoking a big fat joint and walking through the house being like, "Get the [ __ ] out. This is my house." Uh, that worked. It was fine. It wasn't that difficult. And my house is relatively warded anyway, so it was very simple to cleanse it, reseal everything. Plus, I think it was a kid, so they just went home. >> I still felt bad. And I think that's something that people don't think about that if you are going to interact with spirits or or what have you. There is the possibility that you bring it back to your personal space and you have to be cognizant of kind of either cutting those ties, you know, shutting that door, you know, keeping that that boundary between this is your space, but this is my space. >> Yeah. Especially if you're going to do something like we did. Like we didn't just go there to check out the cemetery and see if we got any vibes. >> We used a freaking Ouija board for God's sakes. >> Yeah, we asked questions. We purposefully kind of tried to rile them up. So, we could have been more careful and we should have been. Sheamus was with us. So, we should have made him follow the same protocols that we did, especially because he was coming back to my house. But you know, even if we didn't do anything, I have a belief that people who I don't want to say believe, but for lack of a better word, believe. Spirit knows who kind of gets it and who kind of doesn't. Kind of like they know who's going to pick up the phone if they call. And if spirit really has a message, they're going to try to cling to the first person they think can hear it. >> Good point. So people like you and I, even if we didn't do the Ouija board, we would still want to kind of cut those ties because spirit might try to cling to us as a means to pass a message, say a message, whatever. >> That's a good point. And different cemeteries or graveyards are going to have different a different vibe, you know, depending on what the guardians like, depending on what who's buried there is like or how how it's interacted with. So when you go there, you'll kind of get that feeling. And and this one is definitely active. It's very active. So, we should have taken better precautions. >> Not only is it active, but it's active in a almost like they're lonely. >> Maybe that's why people a lot of people think that there's a lot of children there, you know, or maybe because there are a lot of children there, you know, they they want to play, they want to do something, they want to be active, >> including go home with you. >> Including go home with you. So, a lot of the things that we mentioned are really great things to do. Also making sure to say goodbye. Making sure to tell them. It's it's surprisingly simple the things that you can do to cleanse yourself. You can wipe your whole body down with your hands. Like you said, Shell, cut the ties, literally. You could draw a line in the dirt and walk over it. That can be enough of a barrier that they'll walk up. They'll be like, "A [ __ ] there's a fence here. I can't get past it." >> Almost like create your threshold. >> Exactly. Do it with salt. do it with hot pepper flakes. Uh red pepper flakes are fabulous to make a line. Water, particularly running water is brilliant to stop the spirits, negative energy from following you. You can even drink it. I had a bottle of water in the car and I chugged it with the thought of that cleansing, you know, that water separating me from the spirit world, you know, coming back across the hedge kind of idea. So sometimes you might want to make a relationship with a cemetery. Maybe you're lucky enough to live close to one and you can have a relationship there. Working with the spirits of a cemetery can bring a lot of benefits to a witch, including graveyard dirt, which is not some again, we didn't take anything from this graveyard. I don't recommend taking graveyard dirt unless it is a graveyard or a cemetery that you have a relationship with. But be freaking respectful because you know that is people's final resting place. >> Oh, absolutely. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. And that's why people leave offerings. It's always a good idea to leave offerings to the dead and make that relationship if you're going to go and gather cemetery dirt because it is one of those things that can have a lot of uses in different types of folk magic and magical practices. Should we talk about sealing off your board after you've done something ridiculous like what we did, like cutting the tie with your board, too? We did talk a little bit in a previous episode about things that you can do with a Ouija board to keep it safe. And after opening any type of divination tool like a Ouija board or tarot cards and attempting to contact people who have passed on, is there anything that you would recommend that that someone do if they are trying to invite spirits to talk to them through say a Ouija board or tarot cards? >> Well, I guess I would have to ask first of all, are you looking to speak with anything or or something you're connected to? Obviously, if it's someone you're connected to, if it's your grandmother, maybe you have a pin of hers or something. Um, if you're just going random, give it a go. >> Say in the cemetery, if we had put around that Ouija board maybe some toys or candy or or if we had picked, say, um, there's a couple young Scottish women that are buried right there. We could have picked something that they might have liked to try and draw them in particular >> or just basically trying to use the Ouija board at their grave. Make that connection energetically, you know, >> and then afterwards when you're done, is there anything you recommend after you're done using a Ouija board to contact spirit? >> Usually I like to have it like wrapped in something, you know, kind of like how we have our our our tarot cards wrapped in silk. This one wasn't, but generally I like to have it wrapped kind of like a cleansing cloth. You know, >> I was taught with tarot cards that in order to protect them, you should always keep them covered with a cloth when you're not using them because tarot cards, in order to answer a question, they absorb energy in my belief. You know, they kind of gather your energy, how you're feeling, what your future's like, and and that's what they're that's how they do the reading. So by wrapping them in a a cloth, you're making a barrier between your very sensitive, energetically sponge cards and the energy in the air around them. And so that kind of severs that connection. And the same thing with like a Ouija board. If you put it back in the box or if you wrap it in a cloth, the idea is that you are closing it off from any type of energetic or spiritual connection. For me, for Ouija boards, I feel that as long as the planchett's not connected to it, for me, that's more than enough to close it off. It it is no longer energetically active unless the two pieces are together. >> Okay, I I see your point. >> Some people feel that wrapping it in a cloth, silk or natural fibers are very often preferred, but any cloth will do, or putting it in the box or a special box, putting it behind glass. Some people feel that glass will stop that energy from going through. But for me personally, I just feel that as long as the planchette is not touching it that it it uh has severed that con or if you say goodbye, I do remember we distinctly said goodbye and we kind of closed that mentally when we were done with the Ouija board. We're like, "All right, this is obviously over. Now we're saying it's over. We're done. Thank you." I think of using a Ouija board and I always have using a Ouija board is like making a phone call. In the beginning, you say hello and at the end you say goodbye. You can't be rude to spirit. >> So, we'll be going back. We'll be checking out some other places and trying our very rudimentary, very beginner ghost hunting skills in other places. >> I think that even though we do basic stuff, Leila, you and I always get results, man. >> We do. And they're pretty interesting. I'm very excited to uh put up some pictures and put up some of the different EVPs that we got and see what people think. If you have a recommendation of some haunted place that Shell and I should go to that's in the Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts area, let us know because we will [ __ ] around and find out. >> Totally. Totally. >> You know, we might not do it as pros, but we'll try real hard. So, when this episode comes out, it will be after we have picked our winner for the season of the witch giveaway. >> I am so excited. Just real quick, you all rock, guys. Like, you totally rock. And a special shout out to the folks in Vegas. I don't know if y'all know each other, if you like pulled all your stamps together, but y'all make me giggle and I love it. >> We are very excited. This is a little trippy, Shell, because you and I are talking right now and we don't know who the winner is, but when people are listening to us talking, we will know who the winner is. I don't know if my brain can handle that. >> Weird. Wait. Yeah, weird. >> It's like time travel. I swear >> it really is. Star Trek. >> Yep. But I'm excited to find out who the winner is. So, congratulations to you, whoever you happen to be. And thank you all so much for making our day. I love reading these letters. We get spells, we get tips, we get thank yous, we get so much cool stuff, >> and we get gifts. And you guys, you know, thank you for the gifts. We thank you. Thank you. >> Thank you. All right. Well, our next episode will most likely be on the upcoming holiday of Sin. Blessed Sin is coming up. So, we'll have some information, some tips, some ideas for that. And hopefully we'll be checking out some more haunted witchy places. Lots of interesting things for the season of the witch. This is really my favorite time of year because not just season of the witch, but you know, there's nothing like some good fall, crisp, cool temperature, seasons changing, next tick of the wheel, high holiday. Got to love it. >> I do. And I am so much looking forward to sin with my new Crystal City Circle community. Everything is going so good there. >> Dallas. >> Hey, you've got a great coven, too. >> I do. My coven's freaking fabulous. I love them to bits. >> So, if you are in the northern PA or in the New York area, send us an email. You know, check out Mandagora Magika or email us. We've got some connections. Maybe we can help you find a group for the season of the witch as well. But in the meantime, keep it ghosty, my fellow witches. Stay wise, stay wicked, >> and keep it witchy in the woods with the ghosties, my friends. [Music]

----------------------------------------
It's witchcraft. [Laughter] [Music] Hi, and welcome to the Solarium, Shell and Leila's sunlit herb fil sanctuary, where they kick off their pointy toed shoes, hang up their bessums, and snuggle into over stuffed chairs with some tea and a big fat joint. I'm L I and on this episode we're going to regail you with stories from the underbelly of Salem, Massachusetts. One star reviews. And I'm Shell. And I'm not going to lie, I'm already giggly and we haven't even started yet. So strap on your little witch hats because we're in for a fun night. >> Shell and I want you to keep in mind that we adore most of these places. Now, a couple of them will absolutely deserve their bad ratings, but for the most part, these are undeserved, terrible reviews of some pretty cool places. >> We just get a kick out of how ridiculous the internet can be. And after having a conversation about that ridiculousness, we thought, let's make fun of it. >> To be honest, this episode is a blatant ripoff of the podcast Beach to Sandy, Water to Wet, and you should definitely check it out. a brother sister duo make fun of a one-star reviews and it's a very good time. So shout out to beach to sandy water too wet for the idea for this episode. So first shell what are you smoking? >> Funny story. Okay I had a infused pre-roll not going to lie but let's just talk about gummies and genics for a minute. So, I came to see you and Native American reservation in New York that has these fabulous gummies, which I want to start with the flavor. You know how sometimes when something says it's like mixed berry, it still tastes like ass? >> Yeah, edibles are hit or miss that way. >> They really are because they either have way too much sugar or are way too weedy. These things, you got to be careful. You got to be careful because they are the right mix of candy taste and weed. Wow. >> They're dangerous cuz they are tasty. >> 50 milligrams per piece. >> We've talked about these gummies before. They're the redeye, right? >> Yep. Redeye. >> These edibles, they say 50 milligrams, but they hit much harder. I would think they're very, very good. Very potent. This isn't something you take unless you got some time on your hands. I've smoked a lot. I've eaten a lot of edibles. And I remember one night you were like, "Hey, how many do you want? Are you sure you want two? You you getting ready for bed? You're gonna be okay? I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." Wow. If I had three, I think I would have been in that like glued to the couch state, my eyes barely open. These things are good. >> Yeah. Three is waking up in the morning still stoned. >> You got to be careful with these. Like when it says give yourself eight hours of sleep, no joke, it's like a nightquil hangover. But, you know, I have a bad back and these actually there's something about them because I looked at the ingredients and it doesn't seem like there's a lot of CBD in it. But it does something that like if I'm having a backachche, it actually like is like hits the spot. I just got to find the balance between passing out for 12 hours and it handling my back. >> I really do like edibles for physical pain. They seem to help a lot. >> But these work for me. And as you know, I know you have some scientific mumbo jumbo on why this is, but generally edibles don't work on me. These things whoop my ass. >> Yep. We've talked before about for you how some of the tarpen in cannabis really can help with pain. The four common turppins in cannabis that are best for pain reduction are pinene, lemonine, betaaraphylene, and the one that works best for you, which is mercine. So these edibles probably have very high concentrations of these particular tarpen. >> That 50 mgram man. So what are you smoking? >> I'm smoking what I am calling my season of the higher witch blend which is some >> You made a salad out of a bunch of things, didn't you? >> Sort of. I did an herbal I did an herbal blend. This is lemon cherry gushers and I've mixed it with an herbal blend of mullen, marshmallow leaf, damana and rose. So this is my elevated season of the higher witch blend. >> You always smoke mullen. >> I do. You know, not only does it give the smoke blend a nice taste, it gives it a nice smoke. Mullen is what I would consider a base herb. So, even if I didn't have cannabis in there, I could add extra mullen and that would be the the bulk of the herbal blend because the smoke that it produces has a nice mouth feel. It's very tasty. And then adding in the marshmallow leaf, that's also a good base herb and it gives it also a nice mellow taste. The damana is a little sweet and spicy. And then, you know, I like dried rose petals in just about everything and that gives it a nice sweetness. And together, they all kind of taste like fall to me. I was loving it for this time of year. >> I feel like when I've had a blend with you that had mullen in it, it was just like a lot more smokeoky than expected. >> Yes. >> Does that make sense? >> It does because when you smoke some herbs, people are familiar with lavender or rose petals that doesn't produce a lot of smoke, >> right? >> And those are what I would consider flavoring herbs or secondary herbs. And mullen is >> like a dense smoke, >> right? Yeah. A mullen is one I would consider a base herb because it does produce a thicker, denser smoke. And although any smoke can cause problems in your lungs, have particulates, give you a cough, mullen is an herb that's actually good for your lungs. So yes, smoking is bad. Mullen is good. Smoke at your own risk, I guess. >> We'll do. Thanks for mentioning. >> I do have a little bit of tea before we get into our one-star reviews. Actual tea, not gossip. I'm drinking some blood orange tea that I got at a Moonlight Oddities event where they had a bunch of pagan popups. And this is a local tea store called the Montour Falls Tea Company. It's woman-owned company and they're pretty cool. The ingredients are black tea, orange, blackberry leaves, and safflower petals. And it is very delicious. Now, I did something today that I thought would be interesting. I am having tea that a listener sent us. What is it? It's called I love this name. Between the name and the picture, I get a giggle, you know, especially after a little marijuana. It is called Teeps and it has a rooster on it. And you know, if it's a rooster, I'm just going to call it a >> Uhhuh. >> It is called Everyday Brew. And I am a fan of black tea. This is black tea. And it's actually very tasty. and I love it. So, I I'm having a nice sip of that. I unfortunately don't recall what listeners sent it, but you know who you are and I love it. Thank you. And I didn't share any with Ila. Just saying. I have gotten other tees that listeners have sent in the past and been very grateful. So, thank you all for sending those in. We do love them. Now that we are all comfy cozy in our solarium, the sun's going down. You've got tea. I've got tea. Got a big fat joint here I'm going to pass over to you. Let's read some star reviews. >> Now, I just want to warn you right now that I am kind of pretty high. So, if I get giggling at some of these, just like throw something at the screen. >> Just recently, I was out in Salem, Massachusetts with Shell and we walked around and checked out a lot of our favorite places before the October crowds. As of just recently, October 1st has passed. The crowds are here. The costumes, the performers, the decorations. It's absolutely witchious in Salem, Massachusetts right now. >> To all of our listeners, I did a bad thing. >> What'd you do? >> Well, you were there. You just don't realize where I'm headed with this thing right now. Oh, >> I did probably the absolute worst best friend thing anybody on the planet could do. I I took you to the Witch City Mall bathroom and I'm so sorry. >> You did. >> And I appreciate I appreciate that you're still my friend, but we had to pee and >> porties weren't brought in yet and I didn't know what to do and I'm sorry the smell was so bad. I walked into a wall of scent that was not pleasant. I I think I died and came back and I'm not sure. All I remember is going in thinking it was the worst place I had ever been in my life and then the next thing I know I was teleported out next to you. I think I blacked out. >> In my defense, you can tell I love you because I did tell you prior not to touch anything. >> You did? And that was excellent advice. >> I did. I said do not touch anything. >> Excellent advice. >> But I'm sorry. >> Yeah. I forgive you. I forgive you. It was an emergency. It's the only reason we went. But I don't recommend it, actually. And neither does anyone else. They are in our list of one-star reviews. It was bad. The reviews are bad. I don't recommend reading them. But I also don't recommend that bathroom either. >> You and I are from New York. I would have been just as pleased to like pop a squat under a bush. I would have felt cleaner. >> I've been to New York City bathrooms. I've been to LA public bathrooms. I've been to festival bathrooms after a 10day rainy fest. And I would pick any one of those over the Salem mall bathrooms. >> I have been in a porta potty that was in the 90° sun for a week. And it did not compare to that damn wow. I I have no words. Do you remember back when they had that portaotti at the land that was basically just a big huge Tupperware tub and then at the end of festivals someone had to go dig a hole and bury it. Yeah, the mall bathrooms are worse in Salem than that. >> I would bury a bucket of again. >> Me too. Before don't go in those bathrooms. >> I'm really sorry I did that to you. >> All right, so now that we've gotten all of our jokes out of the way. Well, maybe not cuz we are going to revisit these one star reviews later. Let's start with a review of the old Burying Point Cemetery. >> What could you really say bad about it? It's a cemetery for God's sakes. All right, I want to read this first one. >> Okay, >> Kevin L. One-star review. It is a cemetery. No Kevin L. No The displays for witches in quotes that were killed were interesting to read, but the cemetery is just a cemetery. I didn't find anything interesting about it. A little bit spooky at night, but that's it. What the did you expect, dude? It's a cemetery. Like, it's in the it's it's in the title. Like, it's it's called a cemetery. >> You'd think that the headstones would have given it away, Kevin. I mean, for real. >> I mean, does he think that we've got like like skeletal popups going on? It's a cemetery. Why do you think people want to live next to it? Neighbors are quiet. >> Kevin was maybe expecting something a little more. I'm not sure. So, the next one for Old Burying Point Cemetery is from Beautiful Virus. One-star review. >> Beautiful virus. That tells you something. Wrong. I recently visited the this graveyard right around sunset. I was so completely uncomfortable. It felt as if there was anger everywhere. The stones were all kinds of broken. Some looked as if kids had taken a bat to them. I felt the whole place was completely disrespected. You were not sure if you were walking over dead bodies or not. People walked all over. Liked, they didn't even realize there were dead bodies laying 7 ft or less underneath them. This place should be blocked off. It's not a safe idea. I also think that beautiful virus did not realize that this is a cemetery, not a festival. It's not a marketplace. It's it's a cemetery. Okay. I want to address a couple of things. She was uncomfortable. Okay. Yeah. You're in Salem. I get it. And then anger everywhere. Um, if you were murdered, your freaking spirit would probably be a little pissed. The stones were broken. Oh my god. Freaking 300 years old. Like 300 years old for God's sakes. I would say it is probably the least disrespected place in Salem, >> especially now. >> Okay. When you walk in a cemetery, um, yeah, bodies underground. What are you expecting? >> I do have to say something kind of interesting. Old Burying Point Cemetery prior to 2012, I believe, you did used to be able to walk all over the place, like everywhere. And I had when I remember there was not the memorial at the beginning of it, and there were no paths. You could pretty much just walk anywhere right up to the stones and everything. The reviews from back then are all complaining about how people walked everywhere right up to the gravestones. Nowadays, they have paths and you are not allowed to leave the path. You're not allowed at all to walk on the grass. >> Right >> now, the reviews are all complaining about how there's paths everywhere and you're not allowed to walk off the paths. I just thought it was funny that you literally cannot please people. >> Seriously. Truly. >> All right, Shell. What's the next review? >> Okay. Which city walking tours? Black Ridge Properties one star. If you value faith, history, and truth, I cannot recommend this tour. The presentation was openly dismissive to God, Christianity, and the Puritans who laid the foundation for religious freedom in this country. I'm going to puke before I get done with this. Oh my god. Okay. Instead of proving balanced history, the guide mocked faith and criticized the Puritans as failures. As a Christian, I found this highly offensive. Wow. I find your review offensive. The only reason any of us have life and freedom is because God gives us breath and because of the sacrifices of those who came here seeking freedom of religion. >> Oh boy. >> Wow. to trash those people and belittle their faith felt deeply disrespectful. This is not the kind of history tour I would suggest to anyone who wants an honest or respectful account of America's beginnings. >> I guess they didn't like the fact that the Christians at the time persecuted their own people. I'm not sure what their problem was. I mean, I'm not going to sit here and tell you that every single thing you hear from every single tour guide is like rock solid fact, but you came to Salem and you're looking for like a Christian history. Probably not. Again, what did you expect? >> Yeah. If you go here expecting to hear that the Christians did beautiful, wonderful things during that time, you're sadly mistaken, >> it's not the tour for you. All right, next one. This is also for which city walking tours. This is from Kristen C. One star review. This is a nogo. This walk and talk could be improved with historical accuracy, slowing down speech, clarity of narratives, increased professionalism, and avoiding scaring babies. We would not recommend and actually regret the experience. >> Scaring babies? >> Whose baby did they scare? Did they bring a baby on the tour? What kind of walking tour is this? >> Why are you bringing a baby on a tour? >> I don't even know. These are touted as scary. They're like ghost tours. They're telling the gory history of Salem. Why would you bring a baby? Of course, it's going to be scared. >> Okay, moving on. Bewitched in Salem. Crazy Ronnie. Okay, well, that says it all right there. One star. Extremely rude guy at the door. He asked if I had a backpack on under my cape like I was going to steal or something. I've spent over $5,000 in gift stores this week while I'm here. And I'm a multi-millionaire. First of all, if you're putting it out there, you're probably not like, I'm going to steal from his store. I picked up a bunch of stuff, then left it for them to put away. He deserves this for being rude. Who's the rude one here? Okay, you know, we've already established the fact that I am not originally from here. When I came here, you know, I'm a country girl. I'm from the woods. And someone said, you know, hey Shell, you shouldn't be putting your wallet in your back pocket like that. I'm like, why? I'm just going down the street to get lunch. They're like, well, you do know that all the pickpockers and everybody come to Salem during the tourist season. I'm like, what? They're like, oh yeah, they arrest hundreds of pickpockers every October. What? I'm so naive to this, but people steal from other tourists. They steal from stores. They walk out on restaurant bills. If you are a good enough person not to do that, bravo. Thank you. We appreciate. But don't think that there ain't a hundred other people out there right now pickpocketing, stealing from stores, the whole bit. >> Yeah. So, it's perfectly reasonable for the for a store to ask you to move your cape or if you have a backpack on underneath it. >> Crazy Ronnie. I wish it wasn't an issue. You and me both, buddy. But unfortunately, it is. Here we are. >> If he really was a multi-millionaire, I mean, come on. Really, Ronnie? >> If I was a multi-millionaire, I wouldn't be putting that all over the internet. But whatever. >> Yeah, whatever. All right, so now we get to the infamous Salem Mall bathroom. >> Oh my god, I want to hear what other people have to say cuz I know what I think. >> All right, so first one, Peter B. One star. I only come here to go to the pizza place. Probably some of >> True. Probably some of the best pizza I ever had. Now about the mall. This is pretty much the most disgusting mall I have ever seen. >> Also valid. >> The bathroom gets more gross every time I go. The last time >> The last time I You're making it very difficult for me cuz I have to put music behind this and stop it every time you talk. >> Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. >> The last time I went, someone pooped on the floor and in the urinal. It was pretty unbelievable in a bad way. No wonder there were only a few open storefronts in the place. It's a review that mentions both poop and the best pizza they ever had. It pretty much describes that mall. >> Wow. Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. We had pizza at that pizza place. Damn good pizza. >> I mean, it's New York style. It's very, very good. >> They don't have a bathroom. Just saying. >> No. No, they do not. Nobody does. Pretty much nobody does in >> Yeah. No. Wow. Go to the portaotties outside. Do not go to the mall bathroom. >> I don't obviously I don't have male parts and don't understand some of the bathroom process, but like how do you  in a urinal? >> It happens. People have done it. These bathrooms there is Yeah, there's fluids and stuff and everything smeared on the walls. Oh, it's bad. Okay, read another review. Read another review. >> Okay. Okay. Jennifer Wattro one star super creepy no lady but not in the fun Halloween way that Salem is known for. I felt like I was going to phase into the back rooms at any moment. To be entirely fair, it was Easter Sunday and almost every single shop was closed. Maybe it would have felt more lively and less eerie on an average day. Okay, Jen. No, no, >> no, no. It's always that eerie. >> Thank you for your optimism. No, >> definitely super creepy and not in the Halloweeny way that Salem's known for. No, not the fun scary. All right, so next one. Eddie, one star. A bathroom worse than the actual witch trials. Yes. Wow, Eddie, you nailed that one. >> Wow. >> Yes. Bravo, Eddie. Yes. Yes. Okay, I got I got another one. Last one from BD. One star. The restroom in this mall was so disgusting. When I went on Monday, April 17th, two women in front of me walked in and out just completely disgusted. Trash everywhere, in and out of the stalls. Truly, this was a cursed place. >> Yes, someone put a curse on the mall bathrooms and it is stuck apparently. And the trash everywhere is the least of the issues. >> Oh yeah, there's feces, urine. I don't even want to know what happens. So bad. Oh, scary. Bad. Don't go there. All right, next. >> Salem Witch Village. This is from Richard S. One star review. Ben once will not return. Our princess cruise tour took us to this general area, that being the downtown district. It was established in 1692. We are interested in the revolutionary era and not what we saw here. A few shops and museums. The Salem Witch Trial Museum would be the place to go if you wish to know a little about that unfortunate era of American history. The Witch Village is more dedicated to modern-day socalled witches. So, what you're saying is this guy had an idea of what he would learn and see when he got here and when he was wrong, he was mad. >> Yeah. He didn't like the so-called witches. Are we so-called witches? I mean, I call myself a witch. >> I mean, I call myself a witch, so I >> Does that count? >> I guess. I guess. >> All right. What's the next one? >> Weird. Okay. Moon's Gift Shop. This is Dave Jüksa and he's giving a one star. Neat stuff. Overpriced. Old lady behind the counter. Wouldn't accept cash because she didn't have a bill checker. Was a real witch about it. Um, >> she probably was a witch. >> Well, yeah. You're in Salem. >> All right. This next one is about one of my absolute favorite shops in the downtown of Salem, Massachusetts, and that is the Black Cat Curiosity Shop. They have a bad review. >> One of the few. Troke 4 says, "One star patches on display that are sold out, which is all kind of annoying. Other than that, okay." Okay. What kind of a dick are you when you give a onestar review because you come in October and one thing is sold out, >> right? Oh my gosh, Tro, I mean, seriously, you're going to give that amazing store a one-star review because they were sold out of some patches. That's some high standards right there. I think Troke 4 has some very high standards. >> He ain't getting none of their tea. >> That's true. And they just >> We're going to drink it all. We're going to drink it all. >> Don't go back, Tro, because we're going to have all their tea. And you don't get any. You don't deserve it. >> Okay, moving on. >> Now, you've stayed at this next place, >> the Hawthorne. I have stayed here and I love it. This is I'm in love. One star. Very haunted. No Sherlock. Okay. >> Yes, it is. >> It's the freaking Hawthorne. We stayed in room 614 next to the most haunted room there. We were fooling around with our cameras and we turned on the video camera and heard a voice growl, "Get out!" We took some pics. Every pic had at least 10 orbs. We were getting touched. The spookiest thing was that my parents were praying and all of the sudden a blue cross appeared on the door. We looked and took pics. Wasn't there only on the video camera. We left at 1:00 in the morning. So, do not stay in that room. You just described something I would die to pay for. Hook me up. >> Why is this not a five-star review? Like, why is this not five stars? I mean, I don't get that. That makes no sense. >> Why would you stay in a haunted hotel and then give it a one star? Because you think it's haunted. >> They came with cameras and video. It sounds like they were trying to get ghosts. I mean, one star for getting exactly what you wanted. >> Oh my god, you love orbs. I do. I saw the ten of worms. >> I actually have a few times stayed at the Hawthorne and I will agree. Very haunted, but like you get what you pay for, man. Like you're staying at a haunted place. Yeah, it's haunted. Like again, what do you expect? This town is like over 300 years old. Yeah, >> there's got to be some spooky things. >> Yeah. >> All right. Next review for the Hawthorne is from Kevin Beck. Three stars. And I I picked this one just, you know, it's interesting. You'll see why. Beautiful historic haunted hotel. Beautiful service. Excellent. Bathroom beyond small. You can brush teeth, shower, and use toilet simultaneously. The reason I am deducting points is because my daughter and I stayed in room 525 and were haunted from 2:00 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. This was the scariest. I just think the exact times is hilarious. This was the scariest thing that either of us has ever encountered in our lives. I shouldn't I shouldn't be laughing. We will never be able to forget the experience. I will be surprised if this rating is accepted, but I must report the truth. The place has every ounce of historic charm, but unfortunately this for us included apparitions and supernatural occurrences. I want to go back to the beginning and I want to address the bathroom. >> Why didn't he deduct points for the bathroom? >> Well, I have stayed there. And I will say it's small. >> It is. It's a historic hotel. You don't stay there because you want big, huge, luxurious rooms. You stay there for the history. >> But I had a claw foot bathtub and I took a bath in it. But again, 300 plus years old. Like what are you expecting? And did you not stay at the haunted hotel to be haunted? >> At least this person gave it three stars. That's like the bare minimum for a haunting. I would think >> you paid for an unforgettable experience. And by damn, you got it. >> 2:00 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. Precisely. I love it. >> In my opinion, you got everything you came here for. >> That's right. Should have been a fivestar. All right, what's next? Shell. >> Okay, Crow Haven Corner. I want to point out that that is at the original location of the very first witchcraft store ever in Salem. It wasn't called Crow Haven Corner, but that is the location. Okay. Kelvin J. Hall. One star. I understand. You found paradise in Salem. Had a good trade, made a good living. The police protected you. And there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend of me. What? What? Okay, I'm gonna >> I think you're doing a bit. Keep going. Keep going. >> But uh now you come to me and say Charlotte, stop appropriating cultures, but you didn't ask with respect, you  You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me high priestess. Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to join the ninth generation of Italian witches, and you uh ask me to do a psychic self-defense for money. >> I think they were doing a bit. >> I felt like I was like William Shatner, like giving you like the background of our next mission. >> I think this is like a riff on like The Godfather or something. >> What didn't they like? I don't get it. on the day my daughter is to join the ninth generation of Italian witches. Yeah. >> Is it because no one wanted to be their friend? You don't offer friendship. Like what? >> They took a quote from the Godfather and they slightly changed it to be Salem and Witchie specific, but they're really quoting like a Godfather thing. I'm not sure why. I'm not sure what happened, who pissed them off, what happened here, but there's a story. >> I think he ate more gummies than me. >> I'm pretty sure. I don't know what happened with Calvin and Crow Haven Corner, but uh I think there's a generational curse involved. And um yeah, don't piss off an Italian witch. I don't know. >> Wow. Weird. Okay, what do you got next? >> So, the next one is the Salem Witch Board Museum, which is another place that we absolutely love. >> Don't be dissing on the Witch Board Museum, >> right? Seriously. Awesome. >> What do you got? >> All right, Tammy. One star, We're like, "We already don't like you, Tammy." >> Right. >> It's one and a half small rooms of Ouija boards. Don't waste your money. I spent 20 bucks and then turned around and walked back out. I don't know who is reviewing this because it has nothing to do with the Salem Witch Trials. >> Who said it did? It's called It's called a Spirit Board Museum. >> There's so many places in Salem that don't have anything to do with the witch trials. So, that was your first mistake. Your second is walking in and then walking right back out. Holy crow, Tammy. That place is like stuffed floor to ceiling with the most amazing We Just Spirit Boards, talking boards from everywhere. And the owner, the curator, if you talk to him, holy cow, this guy will talk your ear off. He is a veritable living walking book of knowledge on all things spiritual. >> We spent like two hours there, >> right? Like we could practically not get us out. It was so amazing. And by the way, Tammy, um I don't know when you went there, but the admission is $10. And even if it was 20, I'd pay it again. >> Seriously, it is two rooms, like one and a half small rooms, but it is so cool. And there is so much to see there. I would happily pay the $10 because all of it goes into more boards, so many cool stories, so much interesting stuff. Definitely worth it in my opinion. Moving on to the puberty Essex Museum, we've got reality check Kelly, one star. The museum displays are heavily politicized. 100% woke that is. That's weird cuz uh me and my sweet love went and saw like a shoes around the world display and I don't know how that was. >> How do you make that woke? >> Right. But whatever. Okay. Their approach creates a sour, bitter, and pouting image of many of the artists presenting while showing the curators to be biased and smug. The history of humanity is not pretty. We know that dwelling on the past only hinders valid efforts to make the future better for everyone. >> Uh, it's a museum. >> Isn't the saying, "Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it." Anyway, >> it is and always has been a losing proposition. The curators have never realized this reality. Steer clear of this museum is my suggestion. >> Uh, reality check, Kelly. Here's a reality check for you. If you go to a museum, they're going to talk about history and the past. Just saying. >> What? >> I know you didn't expect this, but they will talk about things that happened in the past and even the shitty things cuz that's history. It's part of history. Just a reality check. Just saying. >> And I want to point out right now they have a great Salem Witch Trials exhibition. Totally worth it. Go. And they have a great little store. And you know how I love to buy things. Now, I don't think that we have Oh, we do actually. Okay. Later, we'll be talking about the Salem Witch Museum. And you'll see next to the title shell. I wrote so many bad reviews. But the Peodyy Essex Museum is actually a fantastic museum to go to. So there are a couple of them in town to go to, but uh we'll we'll talk about one we don't recommend later. I would say PBS6 Museum is more like a what I would call a regular museum. It has to do with the area and history of the area whereas other museums we're going to talk about are like witchy specific. PEM is not witchy specific. >> So, next one. This is for the witch house. This is the Judge Corwin House. Katie Daniel, one star. It just wasn't worth it. The 825. >> It's eight bucks, man. >> The creeks and the floorboards were my favorite aspect of the house. It It was also not a house of the witches, but the home of the judge who sentenced them. I found Salem to be a bit of a tourist trap and appreciated the fact it only cost me $8.25 to find out. I highly recommend the Patrick Doherty installation, though. The cemetery is also really cool and free. You come to a touristy place. What the hell do you expect? Yo, >> yeah, and 8:25 to go through Judge Corwin's house. That is part of the witch trials. That is a big part of it. that house, that's where some of the the people who were accused of being witches were interrogated. >> You and I thought that was like so damn fascinating. >> I wouldn't say it's haunted or anything, but just knowing what happened in that very house, those very walls, those very floorboards, it it's amazing. Some of the historic buildings and things that are still there, and the witch house is one of them. I know that the name of it can be misleading for some people, but listen to a tour guide or something. >> Yeah. or like read. I don't know. >> All right, so we got another one for the witch house. >> Okay, K, one star. Awful. My husband and I went to Salem for our first wedding anniversary. We went to Tales at the Witch House on Friday the 13th because we love all things Halloween and creepy. This is not it. This sucked. We also bought tickets for the next night, not knowing the Pioneer Village would be the same thing. If you want to do them, do the Pioneer Village. It was creepy because you were in the woods. The whole thing was crappy because of the ghost stories weren't anything that anyone could understand nor creepy. Also, they just read from Edgar Alan Poe. Do not waste your money. Save it and do something else. Okay, I have a little gripe and I'm going to I'm going to air it as part of the answer here. So, everybody comes to Salem for the history of witchcraft and witches and this that and the other. What does that have to do with Halloween and Friday the 13th? I'm just saying. Don't judge me, right? >> Don't judge me. And again, you came to a tourist area and got mad cuz you were doing touristy stuff. I'm confused. >> And and I think that both of those things can exist side by side. I mean, it's fun. It's fun to see all the Halloween creepy things right next to the modern witch things and the history, >> right? >> It's interesting. It's one of those things that Salem, I think, holds very well, that energy, that dichotomy of those two different types of energy. The tragic history of people that were not witches but were accused of being witches. The maritime history that's, you know, not as tragic. And then of course the modern-day witchcraft, all the shops, the events, everything with modern witchcraft that you can see there, and also the Halloween and creepy. It all exists at the same time in this beautiful soup of witchy wonderfulness, I think. But you can't be mad that there's peanut butter in your chocolate, you know? It's you have to go there expecting that it's all going to be together, I guess. It's almost like if you want one piece of it, you have to take all the pieces of it. >> Yeah. It's almost impossible to walk down Salem and ignore any of the pieces. You're going to see the maritime history. You're going to see the witch history. You're going to see the Hawthorne House and the House of Seven Gables and the the modern witch shops. You're going to see modern witches. You're going to see Halloween witches. All of it. You're going to see Bewitched TV witches. All of those things exist in Salem and I think that's part of what makes it special. >> People are so damn critical, >> right? Just take it as it is because it's kind of awesome. All right, so now we're going to get into some seriousness. >> All right, Proctor's Ledge Memorial. You and I went there. >> This is actually newer. The two memorial sites are both kind of new and I love them so much. They're so good. >> So Proctor's Ledge was built around 2016ish, relatively new. and behind an old Walgreens of greens. It's weird. >> It's so weird to get to. It is a beautiful moving site. Just super weird to get to >> and on like a one-way road. It's just weird. You'll figure it out. Google will get you there. So, George Pototts, one star jerk. Nobody in the Salem witch trials was a witch or wanted to be a witch. Wow. He reads history. Why do people come to Salem to celebrate their witch identification? They should celebrate the madness of crowds and how it can influence the finding of guilt through intimidation of judges and jury. >> Wow. >> Okay, George. >> I think George missed the whole plot. Okay, I get it that the people who were persecuted weren't witches, but that doesn't negate that they were hung and murdered, >> right? >> We we do come to celebrate our witch identification and and we go to reclaim the witch identification from people that were killed mistakenly in our name and we go to say that they will not be forgotten. What they went through should never happen to anyone, witch or not. And we will not forget the horrors that were hoisted upon those people. And we will celebrate being witches in spite of what was done to those people. >> Georgie boy, think of it as like a Mecca. >> There you go. You missed the point, Georgie. >> Yeah. Weird. Okay, you got one. >> Yeah. Next one. Josh Hunt. One star. I thought there was going to be an actual ledge you could lean off of and take pics like, "OMG, oh no, I'm falling." But JK, so disappointed. frowny face emoji. >> Wow. Wow. Like, >> oh Josh. Oh, Josh. >> Wow. >> Josh. Josh. Wow. Josh. An actual ledge. Josh. Oh my god. Oh no. I'm falling. But JK. Uh, Josh, maybe you need to find an actual ledge and jump off it. >> Oo. Hey. Ouch. That's a little harsh on old Joshy there, Shell. Maybe he just needs to put the vape down. >> Okay, one more for Proctor Sledge. >> All right. >> And this is Daniel Person. He gave it two stars. >> Recycling on the left, trash on the right. Don't enter circle at night. Wow, he's a poet and didn't even know it. >> Right. >> And oh, by the way, there is a memorial there. Go visit your own grandparents or greatgrandparents grave instead. Or go to the downtown memorial. This memorial is not worth seeing. The attempt at poetry, the stopping halfway through. I I don't get this review. This is a great memorial. What do they What do they have against it? And why were they rhyming? >> All right, I have a very big complaint about Salem as a whole that I have been voicing a lot lately, and that is the lack of garbage cans around town for people to randomly put garbage in. >> That's a very good point. Okay, I'm going to randomly interject. One of the cool things about Disney is that they did a study and found that people will only go like 15 paces or something with garbage in their hands before they'll drop it somewhere, >> right? >> So, they started putting up garbage cans roughly every 15 paces. Salem has done none of that. There are no garbage cans anywhere. >> We need trash recepticles >> and recycling ones as well. Both. And now we got Danny boy bitching that he found a freaking garbage can and a recycling one. >> Not in downtown Salem, by the way. >> I mean, really, >> but for real, >> would you rather people throw their garbage on the memorial? Like, dude, >> it is such a beautiful memorial. We'll post pictures of it. Is absolutely stunning. Well done. Good research. And they don't want you in it late at night because people are disrespectful and the actions of one affect the actions of all. So some douchebag did something at night and now they don't want anybody there. Okay. Like follow the rules. I think it is one of the most poignant things to go visit in my opinion. >> I agree. >> But I also agree that you should go visit your grandparents and greatgrandparents graves. He had a point there. >> One point. One point. Maybe that's why he gave it two stars. So, this next place, one of the many places that I had a difficult time finding bad reviews for because many of the reviews are so overwhelmingly glowingly positive, and that is Pentagram. But I picked this one because it just made me giggle when I read it. So, this one is from Baby Cocaine. Two stars. Very commercial. Felt very performative and artificial. Nice smelling candles, though, with two exclamation points. >> Um, I have a three-word response to this review. Kiss my ass. >> Hey, the candles smell good, though. >> Actually, they really, really do. >> But like, kiss my ass. >> I just love that they walk into a business of selling things and are like, very commercial. Well, no Sherlock. That's the point. store, >> right? But had to end it with nice smelling candles, though. Thank you, baby cocaine, for that glowing review at the end. >> Okay, moving on. Count Orlock Nightmare Gallery, which actually I have no frame of reference. Never been there. So, John, one star. John says he was assaulted by employees. Well, if that's the case, stop writing reviews and call the police, unless you're lying. >> Oh, wait. Before you start, I am going to say, spoiler alert, John is lying. There was a response from the owner and they have it all on video. >> Ooh. >> Okay, go ahead. >> So, John writes, "So, I knew the rules and I snapped a few pictures. When they confronted me, I asked to leave. The male tried to keep me from leaving and pushed me. He demanded I delete my photos before I left. About 10 minutes later, a woman who worked there came up from behind me on the street and pushed me. She said it was for me being an  as she walked away. I would advise people not to go. Okay, so you were an You were given specific rules. You chose to break them. >> Yeah. He stated right in the first sentence, "I knew the rules and broke them anyway." >> Like, >> are we for you follow the rules or there's consequences? Like, >> yeah. >> Now, a lot of the complaint reviews for Count Orlock's Nightmare Gallery were over people upset that they were told, I guess, it says everywhere, no pictures. And so when people take pictures, they're asked to delete them because there's also cameras everywhere, which is how I know that John is lying because they caught the whole thing on camera. So if you do go to Count Orlocks Nightmare Gallery, follow the rules. >> Follow the rules >> and don't be an I guess. >> Wow. >> Yeah. Okay. >> No sympathy, John. No sympathy. >> No. >> All right. So KF, one star. Waste of money. Total waste of money. Totated as Hollywood monster history, more like Boreville, Clown Haunted House during haunted Hampenings was simply three people dressed up in clown costumes screaming in your ear. No scare, just screaming. I mean, three people dressed up in clown costumes sounds like terrifying to me, to be honest. That's like my worst nightmare. >> I mean, I don't know, lady. I I I I got nothing for you. I don't know. >> All right, let's move on to the candy company cuz that sounds scary. Now, I want to preface this with I have on occasion been known to spend $100 or more in one shot at this place. So, >> so easy to do. >> I already hate the person who's going to give a bad review. With that being said, ye old Peppermint Company MC one star Kirsten Salem, we purchased a one lb box of assorted chocolate. In short, very underwhelming. Very disappointing. As we were looking to eating them, >> I don't even know what they're upset about. They got a one lb box of assorted chocolates from Old Peppermint Company, the oldest candy company in the United States, let me just say. And how could they be underwhelmed? Come on. This is so good. I don't understand. Why were they disappointed? Were they not able to eat the chocolates? Why were they not able to eat the chocolates? >> Just the thought of Yel Peppermint Company. I I can taste like I can taste sea salt caramels. >> Oh my god, they have truffles, turtle candy. I mean, fruit slices. Like, oh my god. Oh my god. Don't even get me going or I will have to go there tomorrow. Yeah, MC, maybe you have a lot issue. I don't know. >> Maybe you just don't have good taste, MC. >> Yeah. Yeah, dude. It's you. It's not E Peppermint Company, I promise you. >> All right, so the next one, this is a location, just a place, just a statue that has caused quite a bit of division in Salem. And I can kind of understand why. It was donated there by a production company kind of as a more of a advertisement I think. So some people hate it, some people love it. I am in the camp where I kind of like it. This is the Bewitched statue. I am kind of torn. >> Yeah, I'm a little torn. I do love the idea that Samantha was the first accepted witch in the United States. She was an out and proud witch on TV. I guess kind of the character anyway. And people loved her. They loved that show and I like that representation of witches in popular culture being accepted and she was the first one. So for that I appreciate. >> What is your review? >> Patty one star. weird vibe in this location. Not going back. >> You're at the biggest crossroads in downtown Salem, >> right? >> Yeah. There's a lot going on there. And you know, there are some places in Salem where you walk through and you immediately kind of get a shiver. You're like, "Oh, this is a weird spot." And it doesn't necessarily seem to be at some of the historic locations. There is one, and we'll talk about that later, but some of the historic locations are just historic and cool. But every once in a while, you'll be walking down a random sidewalk and you'll be like, "There's something here. There's a vibe here." Maybe Patty was getting that at the Bewitch statue. Well, there is a a thing. So, at the bewitch statue a lot in October, there are people who have different views and that is absolutely acceptable. But there is a gentleman who will set up a very huge speaker right in front of the bewitch statue and with his microphone he usually will spend the whole day there reading his Bible through his loudspeaker and >> really >> he has the right to do that. >> Sure he does. And generally about 10 ft away, Satan is there and he has a big sign because Satan gives away free hugs. And anytime I am walking through there and I see the guy reading his Bible out to the street, I am compelled to give Satan a hug. >> Well, yeah. The Church of Satan is awesome in Salem. And if you are lucky enough to be in Salem in October, there are a lot of street performers that are pretty cool. >> Yeah, >> Satan giving out free hugs. A mustsee. >> I mean, he literally wears a sign around his neck, free hugs. Like, how can you not hug a guy who just wants a hug? >> Sometimes I just need a hug, you know? >> Right. >> All right, so next one. >> We have a snorer. Snorer. Okay. Snorer, one star. Why? Sums up Salem's saturation with irrelevant awfulness. I mean, I don't know. It's awful, but why is this here? It has no connection to the historical events. However, it typifies most of the town's shops and attractions. Fictitious witch foolery, UFOs, Harry Potter and horror films contribute to a feeling of a tacky yearround Halloween tourist trap. The statue typifies this aspect of Salem, ignoring the historical events. First of all, if we have some UFO stuff going on, I need addresses cuz I want to go, >> right? I haven't heard of that in Salem, but that would be fun. Why does everything have to be about the exact history of what happened here? I think modern-day witches want to come to Salem as a almost like a we made it. You couldn't get rid of us, we made it. >> Yeah. Look what they tried to do in our name to people who weren't even witches and look how strong we are now. and to have the very first accepted publicly. Whether it was a fictitious character or not, Samantha meant something to the witch community. She was the first public, even if it was a fictitious first public figure on television and that was a big deal back then. Yes, there is a disified witch aspect to Salem. And the bewitch statue is a little a little bit of an example of that, I guess. But that's part of the fun of it. Doesn't always have to be serious. And there is serious. You can find as much serious history as you want in Salem. Or you can find as much UFO, Harry Potter, fictitious witch foolery as you want in Salem. It's all there. >> I want to find the UFO stuff. The one thing I'd really like to see more of in Salem is resources for witches, like community building, circle workshops, that type of thing. >> Yeah. >> All right, >> moving on. >> Moving on. Next one. Salem Witch Trials Memorial. This is another one that I really like. >> Isn't that really the same really as kind of Charter Street Cemetery? >> It is, but this is the memorial attached to the cemetery. Okay. As you're going into Charter Street Cemetery, there is the Salem Witch Trials Memorial, which again is kind of new. And this is a it's a little rectangle. And as you walk into it, look down because you'll see some bricks inlaid with some of the final words of the people who were killed as witches. And it's moving and sad. And as you go through this this rectangle on the low stone wall, you'll see what look like stone benches. They're not really benches. And carved into them are the names, the date, and the manner of death of all the people who were killed in. >> And a lot of visitors will leave flowers, spell components, coins, momentos on each of these little bench things. >> And as you go around this rectangle, it goes in order from Rebecca Nurse, who was the first, all the way to the last. And it is a beautiful, very moving memorial. Sometimes tours will take you through and talk about it a little bit. You can also just walk it yourself and it's simple but very beautiful, very moving. So, all right. Seaside 16654171683. One star all in caps. Terrible for non-witch lovers. I think this place is good if you are into the witchy stuff. Although I am not, and I found the place rather strange and boring. Would not recommend. Waste of time. >> Okay, seaside blah blah blah blah blah. If I went to your grandma's grave, I might find it strange and boring. Like, what the hell do you expect? You are coming to a memorial. If you aren't into the witchy things, why are you at a witch memorial? >> You could just be into history. You don't have to be into witchy stuff. Just being into American history would make it pretty interesting. So, yeah. And if you're not interested in history, why are you at a historical death? And I'm bitching about it online that it is boring, >> right? Hello. You went to a historic town and you're bitching that it's historic. Yeah. >> Uh >> I think you might be the problem. >> Yeah. >> All right. What's the next one? >> We have the Salem Witch Museum. And this has so many bad reviews. >> Yeah, that's my little note on there. Oh my goodness. You know, normally you go and you look at reviews for a place and you can see it has like 100 five star reviews, 75 four star reviews, and then like this one was completely the inverse. The one-star reviews heavily outweighed anything else. I I have to admit this is the one place and the one thing I'm not a fan and I probably could chime in on the bad reviews only because it was probably put together like the year I was born and that was a minute ago. But Patty H, we'll get her opinion and not talk about mine. Patty H, one star. So ridiculous. was a huge disappointment. You get to watch stationary figures with pre-recorded dialogue. There are no actual trials with actors. It's like Chuck- E-Cheese with witches. Okay, I I I I need to raise my hand here. Um Patty, I actually may have had more fun at Chuck Cheese. Other than the terrible food, I I' I've gotten pretty high and gone to Chuck-E-Cheese and had a good time. Not the Salem Witch Museum. Here's the problem. They do a good story. I got my my shot glass there. But when I say I I think this was put together the year I was born. Like, I'm not kidding. Their biggest issue is they just need to update it. There, I said it. >> This next review would definitely agree with you. This is from Jacob C. One star. Just don't. Just don't. Have insomnia. This will cure you. Boring and not worth your money. And definitely not a museum. More like a dollar store version of a Madam Tousads, but the figures all have some kind of skin irritation. If I were the owner of this, I would knock it down and try again. >> Wow. Wow. Like, wow. Dollar Store. Madam Tousads with skin irritation. Yeah, that that about it. That's beautiful. That's brilliant. Yes. Poetic. Perfect. No notes, Jacob. Perfect, >> Jacob. Okay, dude. 110. >> Nailed it. >> Yeah, but I wouldn't knock it down because the outside is cool. Just redo it. >> That's true. I think that's probably the saddest thing of this whole problem is if you go just go to the outside of the Salem Witch Museum at night and take pictures. Gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. But don't go in and don't pay. All right, so next one. >> All right, we've got Lady Tam. One star. Don't waste your time or money. We hear you, Lady Tam. This is a complete waste of time and certainly not worth the money to enter. Firstly, there is a long wait to get in. Everything in Salem has a long wait. The exhibits are outdated and you have to sit on very uncomfortable metal stools to watch poorly made mannequins get illuminated as the story goes on. The second exhibit is equally as bad, except without the stool. Okay. Okay. Okay. >> Okay. So, you don't even get to sit down. Okay. I'm sorry. Keep going. >> My thought was if it's that boring, I'm going to want to sit and I'm going to be mad if I don't have enough. You know, she concludes it with my highlight was the green button with a little sign saying do not press. Wow. How boring was it that her highlight was a green button with a sign that said do not press. >> Okay. I thought when you weren't supposed to press a button, it was red. >> You think it's killing me. I wish I could ask Lady Tam. >> What's the button, too? Like, why is there a button? I I just need to know. >> Am I going to have to spend money and go find out what the damn green button says? >> No. Not I would not give them your money. No. Not. But I do need to know if anyone has been in there and knows what the green buttons for, please let us know. >> I know we have listeners going this month, and I know they're going to go, you need to let us know what this freaking green button is. >> If you get sucked into going to the Salem Witch Museum, please tell us what the green button that says do not press is for and let us know if you pressed it. >> And double points if you press it. >> All right, last one. And this is our last one-star review, and this is for a store called Omen from Piper K. Three stars. David is an Never trust a man in a Batman shirt and a weird vest to give a tarot reading and not be an >> Okay, let me try again. >> All I can think about is this are laying out a tarot spread going, "I am Batman." >> Batman. Batman. All right, hold on. Okay, I'm going to try and read this again with a straight face. Piper K, three stars. David is an Never trust a man in a Batman shirt and a weird vest to give a tarot reading and not be an Everyone else we met seemed friendly and helpful, though. Nice. Whoa. Okay. I don't know if I would trust a man in a Batman shirt and a vest to give me a tarot reading. I'm not sure how I feel about that. >> All right, David. Why are you wearing a vest with a t-shirt? Okay, I need to know. >> Why are you an And why did it get three stars if he was that much of an Like, was he not totally an  Was everyone else that much friendlier and nicer that it bumped it up from a one star to a three? >> Was it a leather vest or was it real? >> Would that give him more or less stars in your opinion, Shell? >> Why was he wearing a vest with a Batman t-shirt? >> Yeah. Wouldn't you want the Batman to shine through? You know, wouldn't the Batman be the focal point? >> Oh my god. What if he was wearing a leather vest that had like all of Batman's like some You know, the cord to lift him up in the air and his boomerang and his little smoke bombs to disappear. Maybe it was like a utility vest. If it was a utility vest, it could have had like runes in one pocket, pendulum in another. You open it up like you're a flasher, and there's 15 different tarot decks and two oracle decks. But he was still an >> Still an Yeah, prepared  Apparently he's prepared, but an >> All I had to hear was that they were an  And it was like, "All right, enough said." But the Batman shirt seals the deal. >> Yeah. And I guess that's the warning. So now we know. Now we know. You see someone in a vest and a Batman t-shirt, no matter how prepared they are, still an terrible reading from them. >> Weird. Weird. So, now that we've read you all the terrible reviews of some of our favorite and least favorite places in Salem, Massachusetts, you guys should go check it out. See if it's a Mecca, find some history, find some cheesy witchcraft, find some cool, amazing, wonderful, modern witch awesomeness, and maybe find Shell. >> But just don't be mad if you have an expectation and one or two things don't live up to it. >> Expect lines. Expect to not have parking. Expect that it will be very crowded. These shops are super old. They're tiny and they're packed floor to ceiling with stuff. And most of them, almost all of them, are small businesses. They're just owned by local people. >> The one thing you should expect, the best witchy shopping experience of your life. Of your life. Just walking down the street, the atmosphere, the witches, the costumes, the performers, the music, the fall weather, the food. It's amazing. It's amazing. Go and have fun. But remember, your feet will hurt. You will get crowded, and somebody's probably going to step on your toes and not mean it. So, hold off on the curses, >> and you will end up in a bathroom that you might regret later. >> Ooh, I hope not. I hope not. All right, all you witchy type people, we hope you're enjoying your season of the witch because we know Shell and I certainly are. >> And if you find me, we'll get a selfie. >> There you go. Do a little bit of Where's Shell in Salem, Massachusetts? Get your shopping on. Make sure to get all the bright and shiny wonderful witchy bobbles you could ever want. And of course, a little tiny witch hat cuz, you know, apparently everyone needs one, >> right? But until our next episode, Shell and I are going to curl back up, repack this bowl, get some more tea, and chill out in our little solarium. And we will see you next week. Until then, be wise, be wicked, >> and keep it witchy, folks.

----------------------------------------
Welcome to Back on the Broomstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimmooire, where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots after a long period of mundanity. >> We're rewalking the path of the wise, and trying out all the latest spells, rituals, and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices. >> So, grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron, and your crystals, >> and join us as we get back on the broomstick. Hi and welcome to Back on the Broomstick. I'm Laya and this is another episode of The Witch's Answer. We're into the spooky season, the season of the witch. So, we figured we would dive into our mail, our email, and our direct messages and grab some of our most asked questions and answer them all for you. And I'm Shell and these are one of my favorite episodes. I love listener questions because, you know, we kind of talk about things that we think are are relevant or that that we want to touch on, but these are episodes where we can kind of focus on what you want to hear about and what your questions are and some things that you want us to touch on. So, grab a cup of tea and cuddle up cuz we're going to answer your questions. We have a lot of questions. We also have a bunch of things that Shell and I have been up to that we'll be talking about. So, let's jump right into an email. This email is from Jess. And Jess says that she is in love with the podcast. >> Me, too. >> Thanks. Us too. We appreciate it. And she says that she has stepped outside of the Evangelical Christian Church not too long ago. I'm so glad that you're here. And she says her husband actually is the one who suggested that she look for a witchy podcast and that's how she found us. >> Thank you, husband. He is uh exploring runes and Norse gods and fully in support of her pagan witchy ways. Sounds like my husband. I love a supported Norse guy. And she's got a lot in common with me. She grew up in Southern California. I lived there for a while. And she thinks that Shell, she feels like you are her witchy auntie and she wants to have midnight margaritas with both of us. >> She's actually spent a lot of time in the southern tier. Like is this like our our twin person here? Jess has a question for her two best witchy aunties. She says she feels called to Hkate because of dreams that she's had and she wants to know what the best starting place is to explore that connection. Take a deep breath and strap in. >> Yeah, that's definitely from Shell's perspective absolutely a good answer. Okay. You know, I would say for me, I would start with I would set up a little altar to hikate and I would start doing either some sort of little nightly ritual or a weekly ritual. Um, whatever works with your schedule. Hell, if it has to be bi-weekly, bi-weekly or monthly, do what you can. Um, but I would start taking some time to just kind of in a magical space, start start building that connection, start feeling her out in the mundane sense. Learn all you can. Books, dare I say, read what you can online, you know, but remember, >> Serita de Estee, Courtney Weber. We'll we'll put some different links in for books that we appreciate. Uh, Cindy Brandon, a lot of people appreciate Cindy Brandon and her Hakkate book. So, we'll put a lot of information there for you. And I also want to touch a little bit on the dream portion of this because dreams are one of those liinal spaces where your subconscious is basically set free. And so if there's an association with a deity, dreams are very often one of the very first places that that deity will attempt to say >> that first connection. >> Yeah. Because somewhere in your brain, you've made this connection or you're interested or they're interested in you. And so the liinal space of dreams is an easy place to make that connection. And I'm going to add on to something that Shell said where you mentioned the nightly ritual. Shell. Make an altar to hikate and do a nightly ritual. >> Give some offerings. >> Yeah. I'm going to add to that and I'm going to say do it before bed. Make it into a pre-sleep ritual and intentionally ask Hkate for clearer communication. Maybe you have the same type of ritual every night where you pour a little bit of water to Hikate or you light an herb or you know, hey, Shell or I would light a a pre-leep joint maybe and offer that smoke to Hikate. Whatever you're doing before bed, ritualize it and ask Hikate for more information. And what that will do for you magically is plant that suggestion so your sleeping brain can work more with Hikate, get more information from her. And also hypnotically for your subconscious, that's an excellent way to kind of wake up that sleeping brain and get that information into your subconscious, into your magical brain. You can then start to work on it. And yes, I am also going to say journal your dreams. Have that journal right there immediately. this this is the one time I will agree with you dream journaling is the one time well other than my tarot journaling but because dreams are something you can easily you know once you're awake for 2 hours you don't remember so you need to journal that right when you wake up because you will for some reason I can't understand forget that as time goes on the subconscious doesn't form those long-term memories as easily so they're going to slip very very quickly unless you record them in some way so Definitely do your pre-leep rituals and journal that. Journal the information. Journal the synchronicities you see in your life. And definitely in your grimoire, your book of shadows, write the information down that you're learning from the book. And as far as, you know, I said if you can, if you have the space, create an altar. You might be thinking, well, what would I put on that other than the traditional, hey, go get yourself a hkate statue, which by the way, they are so gorgeous. But back in the day when I didn't have such things, I just had a key. That could be any old key. It could be an old key, a new key, a key you found somewhere, the key to your front door. It could be an equal armed X like a crossroads. >> Crossroads. Yeah. >> It could be a dog statue. It could be a dog collar. It could be a stalk of mullen. It could be a torch. All of these things represent hikate. So you can anything that you feel called to. >> Yeah. It doesn't have to be, you know, you don't have to go out and buy, you know, a Hakkate statue for your altar to be dedicated to Hkate, I guess, is my point. Again, gorgeous. I love them, but they're not necessary. You can just have a little key. And what I used to do, and this is so cute. I probably shouldn't tell people this, but I had this little key, and it was a skeleton key. And you know how like in the skeleton key at the top, they have that little those little round areas? >> Mhm. I would put tiny little buds in there as offerings, especially because, you know, you don't want to give up. Weed is a precious commodity. So, I wasn't like leaving ounces there, but a little tiny little bud in the little two holes. And that was my little offering to Hikate. Especially with Hikate, the torch. She is the torchbear. So, candles, torches, mullen torches are fun to make. Or, you know, if you got a joint, roll a little bit of mullen and mugwart in there. And I think that is a perfect ticate torch. But see, I can't because if I rolled the mugwart in there, I wouldn't breathe for the next 4 months. >> So for you, it's just the mullen. I do know that the mullen stalks, they burn like a torch. You can make a big candle out of them. And sometimes they're called hikate's torches. So mullen you can use as an herb for hikate as well. But I do want to point out, you know, maybe you don't have don't have access to these sorts of things. No matter what deity it is, whether it's Hkate, any other deity, it doesn't matter. You can give an offer if it if it is something that has has some sort of value for lack of a better word to you. It is something worth giving as an offering. Maybe honey isn't something traditionally offered to hikate. But if honey is sacred to me, then I can offer it as an offering to hikate because I find it sacred. So there's no right or wrong thing to use as an offering. There are associated things, but nothing wrong. Make an altar, add some offerings to Hikate, and definitely invite information in your sleep, and make sure to journal that later. So, I hope that helps out, Jess. >> Settle up for this roller coaster. >> All right, what's next? >> So, I have something from our Instagram. So, let me just bring this up. This is from and and this is we're leading in still down the Hikate path a little bit. This is from Lady Hartf Fox. Hi, Lady Heartf Fox. >> Hi. So, she writes and and she's so cute. She was like, you know, she thinks we're beautiful people and loves our podcast. We love you, too. >> She's only ever worked with Egyptian gods and goddesses outside some group rituals, which I get. You know, some people are really kind of honed in to one specific pantheon, but the other day she was going to the store and she felt pulled upon to call to Hakate. Normally, she works with Bast. As someone who is very eclectic, if you are feeling drawn to a particular deity or to a particular energy, there's absolutely nothing wrong with learning every single thing that you want to about that deity and working with that energy unless you're in some type of oathbound situation where you are not allowed to, which I think is kind of silly. Knowledge is everything. But yeah, you should go ahead and and and learn all you want. I don't see any possible problem with that at all. >> It's not like you're being a traitor to your sacred Egyptian gods and goddesses by pursuing different deity. >> And and I do I mean I don't see Bass and Hate as being similar. I mean they have some qualities I feel that are similar. I do feel that they are both very protective. >> You know I think that you know like you said knowledge is power. Um knowledge is a good thing. Every day is a school day. But I feel that the more eclectic we got as our spirituality grew together over these last gazillion years, it expanded our spirituality by by expanding our knowledge. You know, the more you know, the more you grow. >> Yeah. Yeah. I agree. And I do feel that if you're working with a deity and then all of a sudden you feel drawn or called to another deity and you're feeling a kind of way about that, happy, sad, guilty, whatever, you should, you know, meditate on that, journal that, think about that for a little bit. There's probably a reason. Maybe you're feeling like you haven't fully explored your relationship with the previous deity. Maybe you're feeling left out. Maybe there's something maybe there's something unexplored there. there's a reason why you're feeling guilty about it. But I seriously doubt that the deities themselves really care. >> Well, and I kind of look at it also as, you know, so she said that she's very attuned with Bast. Well, maybe there's some lessons that she needs to learn from Hakkate that embody qualities and traits that Bast doesn't have. You You know what I'm saying? >> That's an excellent point. I really love that, Shell. That's a very excellent point. Don't get too locked in to to one particular deity because that's that's such a good point. There's so many other lessons to learn, right? Maybe you need to move away from that sensuality, that joy that Bass expresses and and touch on more of your dark side, more of the unseen, that divination, the witchy side of you. Because Hikate for example, you know, you you that like you were saying about that sensual passion side of Bast, but maybe you need to balance that at the crossroads because there's choices to make sometimes. And you know what I'm saying? So, so embrace that expansion is how I look at it. You know, again, knowledge is a good thing and and I think that it can expand lessons and and your experience with your spirituality. I do remember there was a long period of time when we were training and learning where one of the things that we did would be to grab that book of 10,000 goddesses that doesn't really exist and we would work with a deity. We'd usually choose a god and a goddess and we would work with them for a year and a day. You know, your traditional gardenarian wiccan year and a day. I like the symbology of a of a year in a day type of training, but it was a really good way to work with and get information about a whole bunch of different pantheons, cultures. We learned so much doing that. You kept going back to Hikate, which was fine. You still had a lot of experience with >> But if you remember, and this is so bizarre, and the funny thing is I still feel that relationship on occasion. Um, but I spent my year in a day with Ple. Well, she was one of many. I mean, we didn't just do it the once, we did it a few times. Yeah. >> Yeah. And but the Ple one sticks out to me because at that period in my life, as you know, I had some explosions going on and it it was almost like Ple picked me out of that book. I didn't pick her. But you, exactly like you said, no matter what I do, I always go back to Hate. But I've expanded enough with deity knowledge that if I need, you know, if I need love and compassion and that curly you up and wrap you up and hugs and kisses, I might not necessarily Hikate might be a little too prickly. You know, I might call on someone like Aphrodite, you know what I mean? So >> yeah, and by having had those prior experiences, those prior rituals and and working with and meditations to and offerings to other deities, working with a year and a day or or more or less, you have those other relationships to call on. >> Right. Right. So it's almost like you know which auntie to call when you need. You know what I mean? >> Exactly. Exactly. And you've talked to that auntie before you need her help. >> Right. Right. Right. >> Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you hear me? >> I got you. All right, so next question. What do we got? >> Next question. >> We've got this is from Sue. Sue says she loves our podcast. Thank you, Sue. >> Thanks, Sue. >> Sue lives in the Buffalo area of New York and is looking for community like Crystal City Circle. >> When I think of Buffalo, all I think is of is like 50 ft of snow. >> I know, right? So Sue was actually hoping to come to Crystal City Circle events, but they do live kind of far away and is asking if there are similar communities in Buffalo or Rochester. And she says she's torn because she loves listening to the podcast with you and I and thinks it would be a blessing to learn and participate with us. That being said, yes, there are several different groups in the Buffalo and the Rochester area. The Celtic Pagans of Rochester is available. They are actually having a sin meetup at Mythic Treasures, which is one of the metaphysical shops in the Rochester area. And Mythic Treasures is also an excellent place to find local groups, classes, workshops, things that are going on in the area. There's also the Corellian Church in Buffalo, and there are several other groups. I will make sure to put that information here and in the show notes. You can also go to Mandreora Magika and they do have some of them listed there as well. There is Circle of the Green in Rochester. Also upcoming is the Western New York Pagan Pride Day in Buffalo, which will be Wednesday, October 12th from 12 till 8:00 p.m. Not only will you find vendors at Pagan Pride, there's also workshops and meetups, and very often there's a community table section, which Crystal City Circle and Back on the Broomstick was part of for the Central New York Pagan Pride Day just recently. But that's where you'll be able to find all the different groups and communities that are in your area and looking for new members. It's a wonderful place for finding like-minded people. I also want to take a second to talk about Crystal City Circle because that has been going for a couple months now and we are getting >> I'm so jealous. I'm not going to lie. >> This is an amazing group of witches, heathens, magical people. I am over the moon. Just so happy with all of you. >> And you know, I just want to point out cuz I know they're listening. So, I met a bunch of the Crystal City Circle folks at Central New York Pagan Pride Day and you know, Leila and I do everything together and these folks just acted like I was a part of the group with all the lovers and hugs. They would, you know, you wouldn't have thought that I wasn't a part of the group. So, I love you guys and I'm not going away. I'm just far away. You are a long-distance member of Crystal City Circle. >> I am. Crystal City Circle is a pagan community that my new bestie Shannon and I have started in Corning, New York, the southern tier of New York. We do have people that drive more than an hour and I am hoping to direct people in more closer ways to them. Shell and I meet a lot of different connections at the Central New York Pagan Pride with the northern tier pagans, Central New York Pagans, Western tier pagans. So, we are going to try to create a very large network so that we can get people into groups that are close to them. Obviously, I would love it if you came to Crystal City Circle, but we want people to find stuff closer to home so they don't have to be on the road so far. >> Gas ain't cheap, man. >> All right. Seriously. But, you know, hey, stop in. If you want to just stop in to one of our workshops or to one of our rituals, all of that information is online. So, if you're in the area, check us out. And hey, Crystal City Circle people. Hey guys, miss you. But I do want to just also point out real quick that, you know, maybe maybe you're not in New York State and and you are looking for someone local to you and, you know, maybe Mandreor Magic isn't happening for you. You're not finding stuff. If you have a local metaphysical shop, stop down there and ask. They can direct you to groups. Um, or, you know, get on Reddit, put your little question into Reddit. um check and see if there's a face Facebook group for your area because there's more of us out there than I think you realize. But just like with every group of every flavor, sometimes groups are hard to find and you just got to do a little digging. But check out some things locally no matter where you're at and and hopefully you can find a group. The other good place to check is if you have a Unitarian Universalist church in your area. They may have a cups, a covenant of unitarian universalist pagans chapter or like Crystal City Circle, there may be a pagan community affiliated with the local yuyu. Crystal City Circle works with the big flats yuyu in our area for rituals. Thanks guys. So yeah, that's another good place to check. Hopefully Sue, you can find an excellent community that is witchy and wonderful and suits you perfectly. What's our next question, Sha? Okay, so this one comes from we'll just we'll just call her Denise because I don't want to be putting all her last name up on the the old airwaves. Denise asks, you know, she was listening to the spirit energy episode uh relatively recently and it sparked her to ask us a question. Oh, there's a good one, Ila. What creation story do we lean towards? >> I Mine's really good. I really like mine. So, why don't you start? >> Oh, you want me to start? Okay. >> Evolution. [Laughter] >> I do believe in evolution. I do feel that. All right. I'm a little weird and I've talked about this before and I know chaos people are going to jump down my throat because they do every time I say this. >> At least you admit it. >> I do. I do. I believe in the magic of chaos. I believe that sheer chance, randomness, random chaos started the big bang. I think that is magic. I think that's powerful. I think that's deity. >> And again, >> and I totally agree with you. >> Yeah. When I talk about chaos or the magic of chaos, I'm not talking about Austin Osman Spar's chaos magic where you just use the first thing that works and you change it every single time. I know that's simplistic. I'm talking about the random chaos that made the spark of DNA in the soup of the oceans create life, create us, make the perfect everything here. That's that chaos. So that doesn't really have a creation story. Um, so yeah, I believe in science. I believe in evolution, but I believe that that chaos is powerful magic. And I as well believe that it's it's that that exact chaos that kind of like you said created that spark of life, kind of that spark of all that is. >> Yeah. And it's it's really wild to me. I love different creation myths because a lot of them, you know, when you kind of break them down like your crappy English teacher in sixth grade made you do and right when you start breaking down these creation myths, a lot of them sound an awful lot like, you know, sciency, like that spark of creation, that spark of magic. So, I don't know, maybe there's some truth there. Well, I I definitely think that that it's something that can be different between different cultures and traditions, but I do have to agree with you on the science thing. Ila, what do you got next? >> You're going to love this one, Shell. You're going to love this. >> Okay. What's up? >> This is from Rachel. >> Hi, Rachel. >> Hi, Rachel. Rachel's our little sister. >> Okay. >> Rachel is turning 50 next year. I feel that >> on October 27th. >> Oo. >> Right. Right. >> Happy early 49th, little sister Rachel. >> Happy 49th, Rachel. >> Rachel's question. She says in a little over a year she'll be 50 and she wants to go to Salem, Massachusetts for her birthday. Of course, what amazing 50-year-old witch would not? I mean, seriously, >> she knows because she's a smart witch. our little sister. She knows that October is crazy month. >> Can I just say it's a show? Let's just leave it at that. >> Absolutely. She knows. >> No personal space. No personal space. >> She's a smart witch. She's She's got this. So, she doesn't love super big crowds. >> So, we've got some tips for you there. >> But her questions are her husband's having anxiety because he wants to plan the perfect trip. Love that. >> I love him. our little brother, right? He's our little witchy brother-in-law. I love that. We're going to help you out. She wants to know what part of town should she try and stay in. Book now, sweetheart. Two. >> Like, I ain't even joking. Book now. >> Where should she stay? Main places she should go, any underground events or places, best witchcraft shop to go to, best places to eat, and the last one is, are there any public rituals that she will be able to attend? Okay, I got answers to you. >> What we're gonna tell you, Rachel, is we must have psychically known you were gonna ask us this question because I was in Salem not too long ago and Shell and I took video of us in a lot of our favorite places. So, we're going to try and put out an episode just for you. Well, and everyone else, too, on all of our favorite seal and places. So, here's our itinerary. First question, what part of town should you try and stay in? There are two different things that we recommend here. You can stay in historic, really close to downtown, but it's small and kind of haunted. Or you can stay a little bit further out of town, pay a little bit less money, and still stay someplace nice. So, what do you what do you recommend, Shell? You're the local. >> Okay. First of all, if your husband does not want you disappointed, you better book that hotel room in the next two months or you ain't getting nothing. >> A year ahead of time. Highly recommend. >> A year ahead of time. Now, there there isn't really that many hotels in Salem because it's really a small town, believe it or not. So, if you can book in Salem, obviously, that's what your first choice is going to be. Do it. I recommend the Hawthorne. Love it. Super haunted. >> Small. >> Yeah, it is small. There's the Salem waterfront. Check that out, too. It is on the water, but less haunted. If you cannot get a place in Salem, my first recommendation would be for you to check out Peabody, Danvers, or Beverly. Um, if you can get in puberty, Danvers or Beverly, you are either a short car, train, or Uber ride away. >> Exactly. And that might be better for you if crowds are not your thing. This will give you a way to get out of the area. >> Yeah. And plus, there's a lot of choices, a wide variety of budget choices as soon as you get outside of Salem. >> Right. Right. What What was the next part of that main go? >> What are the main places? And I highly recommend when you go check out the historical sites. Check out all the historical sites. And I'm going to give you a quick itinerary. And Shell, the local will interject. Yep. So, I'm going to say check out the PBD Essex Museum if you want. You can also go to the Gallows Hill Museum/the. I do like obviously PB Essex Museum is fabulous. I do like the Gallows Hill Theater. They have a haunted house down there and it's actually kind of cool. and you're going to scream a little more than you think. Me personally, I'm not a fan of the witch museum and we're just going to leave it at that. I think it was decorated the year I was born and let's just say that was a minute ago. So, that's one you can definitely skip if you want to >> in my opinion. Yes. >> Yes. All right. So, now the ones we really recommend are the witch house at 310 Essex Street. This is one of the original houses. Granted, it's not in the original spot, but it is the original house. Very interesting. Has lots of artifacts. A little trippy to look out the windows. I love it. >> You know, I remember when we looked out the windows, it it you had made this comment. It is interesting to look out the same pane glass that someone looked out 300 years ago. >> Right. Pretty trippy. We also recommend the old Burying Point Cemetery on Charter Street. >> Yep. >> The Salem Witch Trials Memorial on Liberty Street. >> Yep. Proctor's Ledge Memorial. >> Absolutely. >> Now, granted, this is a little weird to get to and park at >> just a little bit. >> This is a memorial that was put in way after everything was built in town, and it's basically historians looked and found where they believe the actual location of the hangings took place. So, everyone except for say Giles Cory who was pressed to death was killed in this area. And there is a very beautiful, very moving memorial right where the hangings took place. Definitely go there. Hard to get to. Go there. Anyway, >> there's one more place that I would recommend that you did not mention, and this is probably one of my all-time favorite places in Salem is the House of Seven Gables. >> Oh, yeah. That I was going to mention that later. >> Oh, okay. >> There's a line. There is the yellow line that you can walk and that goes to a lot of historic locations. We did not mention all of them. There are a ton. There's tons. >> These are just our favorites. Now, shopping. Name a couple of your favorite shops. >> Oh, boy. I love pretty things. >> I have a list right here if it helps. I'm going to read the list. >> Why don't you read the list? And if you forget anything that I absolutely love, I will interject it. I'm cheating because I have our itinerary here from when we did our trip. >> All right. So, the first one I'm going to mention is, of course, Hive and Forge on 30 Church Street, Salem. That is my absolute favorite. local artists, local crafts, beautiful, beautiful witchy  Oh my gosh, I love that. >> You just love stores that sell bones. >> I do. That's true. I do. It's a fantastic place. I'm also going to mention Pentagram Witchcraft and Magic Shop. Wonderful, fabulous place to get things. Also a great place for tarot readings. >> My best recommended place. >> It is recommended over and over again. I'm also going to mention the Cauldron Black on 65 Warf Street. Now, this was mentioned by a listener as one of their favorite places to shop. It was. That's also a good shop. >> Excellent place for jewelry, the Village Silvermith. We've also got the Covens Cottage. Some people really very much like that shop. One of my favorites to go into is the Black Cat Curiosity Shop. Love their tees. They're super cute. I love their tea. I really do. Now, there are two locations for this next shop. One is a little further out of town, and boy is it fantastic. And this is run by twins who are also witchy tattoo artists. This is the Black Bell Shop of Dreer and Wonder. You know, they just their stores are just cool to look at. Very Adam's family. >> It's so cool. Also slightly outside of town, but excellent excellent jewelry. Raven Stone. Love these guys. You got to go. >> This is like your crystal mecca. If you are into gemstones and crystals, you need to take the drive outside of Salem. Go to Raven Stone. >> Tell them Laya and Shell from Beck on the Broomstick sent you. >> Exactly. We also recommend Old School Pyramid Bookstore. Got to love them. The Sea Witch and Crow Haven Corner, which is the oldest witch shop in Salem. >> Okay, so we've got Underground Events or places. So, some of the other places that are not on the historic tour or the shopping tour, Shell and I love and honestly I think is one of the more haunted places, the House of Seven Gables. Probably the one place in Salem that I can't get enough of. I mean, you know, I've been to the witch house. I I almost have every nook and cranny memorized, but I feel like every time I go to the house of Seven Gables, I don't know. There's something weird about and trippy about that house. I feel like it like >> take a tour. It's different. >> Take a tour. The tour guides have amazing information. They have lots of great things to say. Super cool place. And even if you don't go on a tour and inside the museum, wander around the grounds, the gardens, the old old houses that they moved there. You will see around Salem houses that are painted like a dark gray. >> Yeah, I look at them as more like black. >> They do look black. It's a It's a preservation paint basically. I think honestly that that is um kind of how they kept things back in the day though. A lot of those houses were like that dark wood that were painted dark to repel. It's some sort of repellent, some weather repellent. >> Yeah. The black houses are all old historic houses and you'll see a lot of them with dates and plaques on them. But if you see a dark gray black looking house, they've been painted that way specifically to help preserve them. But that they're very easy and distinct to see. >> I did want to mention real quick that there is a second color you will find in that same vein and it's almost like a burnt red. So if you see like a burnt red house or a black house. All right, another underground place that is our absolute freaking favorite is the Salem Witchboard Museum. Oh my god, I love this place. And the thing about this is even if you've been to Salem before and you've been there, you have to go back because I don't What did he tell us? Every 3 months, every four months. >> Yeah, he changes it. >> He totally redo everything. He has such a a stockpile of boards that he changes out the display every 3 months. So, if you go today and then you go four or five months from now, you're going to see totally different boards. >> We also think that you should go to the Satanic Temple on 64 Bridge Street and Hocus Pocus locations. Everybody goes to Hocus Pocus locations. >> Yeah. The easiest one is the Ropes Mansion, which is Allison's house. They have a gorgeous garden that you can walk around. They decorate for Halloween. >> It really is gorgeous. >> Yeah. >> Take pictures outside of that. It's great. You can also go to Max and Danny's house, 98 West A in Salem, right on the water. It's beautiful. >> Just be respective cuz like people actually live there. Don't be a jerk. >> Yes, please be very respectful of these places. Same thing with the Ropes mansion. People do live there, but they're really nice with their time. So, uh there's also a couple other locations that you can look up for Hocus Pocus locations. You can go to Count Orlock's Nightmare Gallery, the bewitched Samantha statue, which is a controversial fun place to go. Which side do you land on? Love it, hate it in the middle. What do you think of of Samantha? >> Okay, so funny you asked this cuz I actually have an opinion here. I loved Bewitched as a TV show. Growing up on reruns, I loved that show. Go figure. The statue is gorgeous. Do not get me wrong, but she was not from Salem. Okay. Yeah, one episode, two episodes were filmed here, but it wasn't about Salem. It wasn't filmed here. Like, there is no association with bewitched in Salem other than she was a witch and this is witch city. So, I don't understand it, but I like it. In my understanding, the way I understand it, I think that witches, like modernday witches, have nothing to do with Salem either. I mean, it was Christians that were agree. Don't get me wrong. >> Right. No. Right. No. No. I know you do. I know. I'm just saying that this is how I understand it is that witches don't really have an association. None of the people that were killed there were witches. They were persecuted kind of in our name. So, that's how I see we reclaim the city in that and we're reclaiming that in So, I think the same thing about Bewitch. Samantha. I loved that show. I still kind of love that show. >> They should put that back on TV, >> right? Seriously, I'd love to see a reboot of it. >> Dead and I dream a genie. >> But the thing is, she doesn't have a connection to Salem, but she does with Witchcraft Revival. She was the very first public on TV witch and she was accepted and she was a witch witch and people loved her and they loved that character. And so I think in the sense of reclaiming that, she's the first out public witch. >> Now that you put it that way, I guess. >> Yeah. So that that's kind of how I see it. I I completely understand that there's a lot of different viewpoints on it, but I think it's kind of cool. >> I get what you're saying, but if it were me, I would put a statue of Lorie Cabbat on the corner of Essex Street. >> Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. All right. So, I think food is another one. We got to do this one quick because these are a lot of questions. Some of the best places that you can eat. You got to get candy after you leave the house of Seven Gables. Go to the oldest candy shop right across the street. Get yourself some dark chocolate sea salt caramel. I spend way too much money at the Ye Old Peppermint Company, right? So good. Where else would you recommend, Sh? If you're looking for a good seafood dish, um, Turners 110%. If you like lobster bisque, oh my god, I cannot recommend that more from Turners. If you're looking for pizza, go to Amazing. It's not a pun, it's amazing. It is really the best pizza on the planet. That's no joke. Sushi, uh, go to Cotto. If you're looking for Mexican Howling Wolf, the best burritos on the planet. >> All right, so I'm going to cut you off there because we're gonna have another episode where we talk about a lot of these. >> I do want to answer the last question because this is something we didn't talk about in our video and and this is something people who come to Salem do often wonder. And Rachel's last question was she wanted to know if there was a coven or public ritual uh that she could connect with and and attend some sort of ritual while she's here. Now, I know you would think that there would be a lot of opportunity. There's really not. If you go on the old googly Google or on the old Facebook and look up the Lori uh what is it? Lorie Kitts, the Kabat Kabitt Cat Hermetic Temple or the Witches Ball. You will find that there are one or two public events. I'm not sure. You know, I don't know if there's a cost. I don't know the details. You're going to have to look that up. But I do know that Lorie Kitt's group does do a a public thing. But otherwise, there's not a whole lot of public ritual going on here. Just so you that expectation is kind of so you know where you stand. >> Next question. Okay, I've got one more Instagram question that I wanted to mention and this is gonna this it might be a little a little leading into another topic, but we have a podcast listener called Raining Light is how she goes on the old Insta. So, Raining Light asks, you know, she loves our podcast. She just recently found it, so she hasn't gotten through all of our episodes, but she wanted to ask us a question. She was listening to our episode. I don't even remember what one it was. I think it was in the 40s or something about dismantling, destroying, cancelling, getting rid of a spell jar. >> Oh, okay. >> She had made a spell jar for a person and she's to a point now where she thinks that it's time to dismantle it, but she's anxious. You know, I she wants to do it carefully. She wants to do it right. She doesn't want any backlash um for dismantling it. and she's not wanting to touch it or do anything with it, but she feels the need to do it, but do it in a very careful manner. So, she's asking if we have any tips on how to properly dismantle, disassemble, or kind of break off a spell jar. Oo, excellent question. All right, so first thing I have to ask is, what is your intent with dismantling the spell jar? Are you dismantling it because you're ready for this person to come back into your life? Are you dismantling it because it has done its job and you are ready to just have it continue the way that it is? Why? Why are you dismantling it? And that's going to dictate to me how you dismantle it and how you dispose of the things. >> Yeah, I I totally agree with that. You know, why did you put it together in the first place? What's transpired since? And why are you taking it apart at this point? You know, those are all things to consider. I think the two most common reasons someone wants to dismantle a spell jar is one, they want to dismantle it because whatever problem was being caused has passed, the work is done >> and they're okay with the relationship kind of coming back maybe slowly into their life. Dismantling the jar is a good way to do that. Have you ever bought crystals shell or something from a a shop? >> Too many. >> You know those little clear bags a lot of people will give you for jewelry or for crystals or things like that? Those just those little cute bags. Sometimes they're different colors. A little drawstring bag. >> The little They're They're like little net bag things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. I like to save those because they're pretty and I can do spell jars in. >> I literally have a handful of them right here. >> They also work very well as a mental trigger for a circle or a protective magical space. So, what I suggest, take the spell jar, set up my ritual, set up my spell with the intention that I'm going to dismantle this because the work is done and I'm ready for things to just return to an equilibrium. Put the jar in that bag as a circle. And in my mind, that now creates a magical barrier that contains all the energy in that jar. So, when I crack the seal and open the jar, it's not going to go anywhere. It's contained in that bag. So my intention then is I separate out every single piece dumping it inside the bag and with the intention cleanse each of those pieces still inside the bag. Thank them for their energy and their aid in this working. Tell them that the working is done and then just sit with that until the energy dissipates inside that bag. And then I would dispose of each piece as needed. either put it back on an altar, bury it to then dig up later, you know, to get rid of that energy and earth that energy and then dig it up and bring it back. Maybe run it under running water and then put it someplace to store and use again or throw it away if I'm done with it. Now, just a couple things that I want to add to that cuz I have a similar method. I like getting the big containers of chocolate covered raisins at at BJ's. So, I have kept one of those big plastic containers and I've filled it with dirt. And what I what I like to do is I like to kind of bury that spell jar in dirt. But, you know, who's going to do that in your backyard? You might not find it again. So, it is a container. And I'll bury it for a period. It might be moon to moon or from a full moon to a dark moon or a dark moon to a full moon depending on the intent. And then I will, like you said, get it out, start dismantling it. I do like to if it's just herbs because it depends on what I made it for. If it's just herbs, I like to give the herbs back to the earth, but otherwise I dispose of the contents appropriately. I like to reuse. Who doesn't like to reuse little glass jars? So, I will come up with an incense. I will either buy it or I will make it, whatever. And then I will use incense to cleanse my container because I do generally want to reuse them for other purposes later on. So, I did want to interject, you know, if you are going to reuse the container to definitely kind of even though I've buried it and kind of released it, I still want to at the end cleanse that container again so that I can reuse it for a different purpose. The only other thing I would do differently is if if this is a spell where I'm done done, like the spell has done its work and it's gotten them out of my life or whatever, but now I'm done done. I'll just throw it away. Dispose of it. Get it out of your life. Get it away from you. The act of throwing it away shows your feelings for that. It's garbage. It's done. You know, if that if it's that type of thing, if it's a get away from me or a freezer type spell, just throw it away. >> Again, you have to kind of determine why you're opening the spell or ending it. >> We do hope that that helps, but that segus into something that that you were talking about. So, Ila, funny thing. I heard a rumor that you happened to get someone else's spell jars. How did you come across getting other people's spell jars? By the way, >> uh I've recently discovered the joys of local online auctions. It's >> Oh, that's my jam. >> It's bad. >> It's my jam. Not too long ago, I stumbled upon an auction that was just one town over that happened to be full of witch >> What are the odds? >> Right? I I started looking. I'm like, "Hey, that's a book about tarot." And it's bundled with a whole bunch of crystals. Like a lot of crystals. Then I noticed there was a good six or seven lots that were all witchy bundles. There was tarot cards and crystals. There were some books and crystals. There were >> Yeah, there was there was jewelry. This person had gotten a paintings done of themselves. >> You are like tweaking my thrift like every thrift fiber of my being right now. >> As soon as I realized what it was, I tried to win every single lot. Unfortunately, I was outbid on a couple of them, but I got >> love that in and of itself that you actually were bid against. >> Yeah. Hopefully, whoever got them was also very respectful and and and very appreciative of what they got. But when I got them home, I spent them time with everything. I cleansed it. I treated it very respectfully, and I worked with it for a while. I sat with each piece to to learn its energy. There were four spell jars. >> That one kind of eaked me out. I'm not going to lie. >> Yeah. Well, you know, you you can kind of get a feeling for the energy. And I showed them to you and you picked up on the same exact feelings I jar. So, >> but at first glance, I'd be like, "Oh  I got somebody's spell jars. What's this about? >> Yeah. Yeah. It felt like a big heavy responsibility. It still does. I I have put them on my ancestor altar. They are in a box. They are in a container on my ancestor altar at the moment. And I know what I plan on doing with them, but I kind of wanted to put that question out to our listeners. If you guys could email us, DM us, write it in your letter, but what would you do if you somehow inherited or came into possession of someone else's spell jars? And I think it's interesting if I if I gave you a box of stuff and you were like, "Oh, wow. Shell gave me a bunch of spell jars." You know, that would be different. But Leila, you got some stranger spell jars. >> Yeah. And that's a stranger's spell jar. It's not like like I gave you used spell jars and you're like, "All right, let me just dismantle these." Like it's a stranger. There's like a a deeper level to it. >> Yeah. And if it was just sitting there, I would never have grabbed it because that's not my That's someone else's spell. Not touching it. Thanks. >> Right. Right. Right. Right. >> But because they came into my possession, I feel like and I did not see them. These were not listed in the lot. This was just kind of part of the lot. So, I feel like they came to me for a reason. I also feel like even though I do get a very strong sense of what each spell jar is for, I don't feel like I should open them. In my particular case, I feel like this person has passed on. It's not yours to dismantle is how I feel. I do not know exactly what workings this person put into effect. So, I plan on and spelling these. I'm wrapping them in energy. Not negating it. I'm being respectful, but I'm wrapping them in energy. And I do plan on keeping them on an ancestor altar as that type of item. So, they won't any longer be putting energy out anywhere. They'll just kind of be in. >> They'll just be >> Yeah. They'll just be in stasis. Yeah. >> Yeah. I like that. It's very that's very respectful. >> Yeah. And I I will keep them as a momento on my ancestor altar. Even though I do not know who this woman was, I do feel a connection to her and so I want to honor her in that way. But I would love to hear what other people would do if they came upon or inherited in some way some spell jars. Let us know. >> Let us know. Oh, I'm I I'm Oh, that's just the there's just it makes me want to like find out whose they were and research the person and you know, I'm so nosy. All right, next question is this one's short, but it's got a little bit of a longer answer. This is from Maggie and Maggie says, "Have you ever talked about working with a fetch?" And we have not. >> Okay, Leila, I don't mean to sound silly. I do not know what a fetch is. So you are going to have to educate both of us. Or maybe I know what it is and don't know what that it's called that. >> You've probably heard of it in a couple different ways. So fetches are heard most often in fairy tradition or British traditional witchcraft. And this is the idea that every person has a shadow self that you have a double >> like Peter Pan >> kind of. Yes. Like Peter Pan's shadow could be considered his fetch. >> Okay. >> Yes. That's a good example. >> Okay. I got you now. >> It's part of your soul. It's part of who you are. It It is you, but it's also like a double of you or a shadow you possibly. It could be a spirit self. In some lore, it's like a guardian spirit that it kind of watches over you. Sometimes it can be a witch's bridge between this world and another. You would send your fetch to the spirit world to get information. Your shadow self, you but in shadow form. You have a relationship with your fetch and you can talk to your fetch and have them do things. But again, it's you. It's a part of you. Fetches are similar to say a tulpa or a familiar or an aggregor. >> Okay, I know what it is. I just know it by a different name now. >> They're not the same thing, but they are in the same kind of energy form category, I guess. >> Okay. Okay. differently like a a familiar. Say let's talk about like a familiar. We've talked about that before. A lot of us like to talk about our pets as familiars, which they kind they're a simple familiar. Yes. >> Right. >> But a familiar >> They're not always pets. >> Right. Right. A familiar, a true familiar is a spirit that you have bound to you. It's a partner that you have bound to you. It's a spirit, an energy of some sort. >> I just never heard of it called a fetch before. >> That's different. A fetch is you. A familiar is an external spirit that you have kind of called and or bound or contracted with to work with you. Your fetch is you, your shadow self, a part of you like well like you said like Peter Pan's shadow. It's that's him part of him. So like a a Tulpa is also similar. A topa is more of a a thought form. It's a spiritual power, you know, something that you create kind of like an egregor. You know, you've got an egregor that's an entity that a group of people's ideas and thoughts have created, right? And it becomes its own thing. Like we've talked before about working with the egregor of the United States, working with Lady Liberty or working with Lady Americana or some other type of of agregor thought form that you create. Uh sometimes pop culture icons can become egregor, deities that have this energy because so many people think of them in that way. But again, slightly different than a fetch. A fetch is >> a part of yourself like your darker side, your shadow side, your mystery side. >> Yes. >> Side. >> Yes, she got it. That's exactly it. Yes. So, if a witch is wanting to be safe but maybe wants to go somewhere, you would send your fetch. You would send Some people send their fetch when they're dream walking. >> I was going to say it's definitely It seems like you could utilize your fetch in in a dream state and dreamworking. >> Yeah, I guess you could kind of say soul. That's kind of similar. Your soul is your fetch. You know, you kind of send it out and bring it back. But yeah, it's definitely connect connected a lot to you'll find it a lot in uh British traditional and fairy traditions. Uh you'll see them sometimes related to actual fay or fairies. Sometimes the she like banshees. But again, banshee is not you. It's just another spirit. So yeah. So there's that. I would love to have an episode where we talk a lot about fetches and thought forms and agreores and things like that. It's pretty interesting. >> Put it on the calendar. >> Right. All right. So what's next? Okay, so we have a listener, Kimberly. Hi, Kimberly. >> Hi, Kimberly. >> Kimberly wants to know, "What is the difference between fortunetelling cards and tarot cards?" Um, when she was a early learner in her practice, a fortune teller told her that she had only used the fortuneelling cards, you know, those or the thin orange boxed ones. Um, and that others tarot were different. And she wants to know why. Kimberly, have I got an answer for you. And so doesn't Ila. I'm just going to say one short thing and then you give a good >> Go for it. Go for it. >> I had to look it up. I could only think of one fortunetelling cards that came in an orange box and I had to look it up to check. But the only ones that I could find are the Gypsy Witch fortunetelling card. >> Well, that's what I was thinking she was talking about to be honest. I had the same visual in my head when I read it. >> Yeah. So, I'm going to assume that that's what it is. But if if you know of a different fortuneelling deck in an orange box, let me know. Go ahead, Shell. Give your answer. >> So, you know, that particular deck, um, the one that Ila just mentioned, that is kind of based on the system of the playing cards, >> the Lenorand, >> right? And tarot is more, how do I say this? In-depth picturebased. There's meaning in in the pictures and the artwork and what have you that you find in tarot because again, you know, 24040 decks. It's an addiction, not an addiction. You know, different artwork, different artists are are using their artistic vision to kind of portray the same meaning. Yeah, >> but I look at those gypsy fortuneelling cards as like I can glean a lot from a picture and symbols and symbology. But when I have used those particular cards, it's kind of more going on for me anyway, and this could be totally different for other people. It could be totally different for Ila, but I kind of just go on the I know what the nine of hearts means. I know what the king of spades means. And it's kind of going more on my intuition and knowledge more so than gleaning from symbology and making patterns out of those symbol symbols based on what card is next to what card is next to what card and putting those visuals together. So I mean ultimately yes there's a difference but it's a different means to the same end. I'm going to have a two-part answer to this question. The first one is tarot cards. Like Shell said, that's a 78 card usually deck that is rich in symbology. The Gypsy Witch fortuneelling cards is a 55 card deck that's based on the Lenorand deck, which like Shell is very much like a deck of playing cards. In this particular case, >> the the Gypsy Witch deck does have a lot of pictures on it and it tends to be very literal. When I've used it, it it's very blunt, very literal. Leila, I could say the same thing about tarot cards, though. >> Yes, but but tarot cards, you can very easily weave a story. There's so much information in each card. It's very super easy to weave a very detailed story and you can get caught up in all the details on >> Oh, I see what you're saying. Where this is more like A, B, C, there's no path. This is this. We are just being blunt, moving on. >> In my experience, Lenorand in particular, this deck does seem to be very, very blunt. That's just the differences. There's a ton of them. Oracle cards, Lemon cards, so many different ways to get to the same end. It's not my preferred method just because I I love that rich symbology and weaving that story. But ultimately, when you're talking about, you know, doing a spread, it's kind of six of one, half a dozen of the other for me personally. >> And and that particular reading saying that she liked a particular deck and did not like the other ones or or she didn't. She said that the others tarot were different. She's correct. They are different. There's a different number of cards. They have slightly different meanings. It's just a different divination system using cards. >> And it's not that one is better or worse than the other. It's just a personal preference. Exactly. Like the lenomard. And you know, this method is not my personal preference. I like strictly tarot. I don't even like oracles really, but Ila, you kind of flow with it all. >> I Yeah, I really love tarot. That's definitely my jam. I'm most comfortable with a tarot deck, but I do also love the oracles. I love adding them in together. I love adding multiple decks together. So, yeah, I guess you could say I'm the rebel tarot reader. I like >> That's a perfect description for you, Laya. That we need a business card that says Leila, the rebel tarot reader. >> There you go. There's our next workshop show. >> Right. >> All right. So, this next question kind of flows with that one. Exactly. This question is from Angie and Angie says, "I really want to get into learning tarot, but I need a good deck to start with. Can you suggest?" >> Oh, girl, we got you. We got you. >> What would you recommend, Sh? >> Oh, boy. So, I do like Pamela Coleman Smith writerweight Centennial deck. I do love that and I do think it is a very basic deck. But if you are like rock solid brand new, maybe you just need the bright, you know, the bright yellow writerweight deck. >> Is there really a difference between those two decks? They're the exact same deck. >> Yeah, but we have to have Pamela Coleman Smith be number one. Come on now. This is what we're here for. We've talked about how I kind of tend towards the Celtic path. So Robin Wood I think is a good one. But you know that that symbology has to speak to or it ain't going to work. Yeah. It is personal preference but something writerweight Smith Coleman um you know something like the Robin Wood um the 1909 deck. I hate to be simplistic, but anytime I've ever taught anyone tarot, I always tell them to grab a riderweight smith clone, a Smithweight deck that they like because there is so much information out there. Every book pretty much is geared toward a Smithweight deck. So find a Smithweight clone that has the imagery that you like, that resonates with you, and learn on that one because it's easy, because the information is there. It's everywhere. The second half of that is go to a shop, go online and just look and find which one calls to you. Which one are you most interested in because that's the one that you're going to pick up and want to use every time. >> I think the better advice for Angie is start with a writerweight Smith Coleman version and then once you get a good feel for it, just start buying all kinds of decks until you find one you love. >> Start a collection. Start a collection. >> I am pro tarot card. >> Do not spread your addiction. I am spreading my addiction. It's an addiction. Addiction. No, >> you need to resist. >> Bye, tarot. Bye, tarot. Bye, tarot. >> So, Ang, I hope we answered your question and good luck with your tarot adventures. >> Good luck. >> All right, I got one last question, Shell. >> Lay it on me. This one is actually from our Reddit board and I pulled it because I don't think this one's been answered in a couple days. I think people are scared. Shell. >> Ooh, what scares people, Laya? Tell me. Tell me. Kill me. This question says, "I have a spirit board I have been unsuccessful in using alone. Now my mom wants to use it with me. I assume to talk to her dead mom. Any advice to make sure we stay safe/ don't do anything stupid? I'd ask in another forum, but people from the internet are mostly mean, and I'm hopeful this community won't be." They say, "I'm taking Florida water just in case, but any additional advice would be much appreciated." You know, >> Ila, why do spirit boards get such a bad rap? >> Because of movies. Honestly, it's movies. Okay, first of all, the first thing Shell and I are going to tell you people, spirit boards, Ouija boards are just another divination tool. >> You're fine, people. >> Now, the next thing I'm going to tell you is identify your own personal biases when it comes to the Ouija board. >> Oh, you know, I thought about that. Yeah, >> because that's going to determine whether you have a good time or a bad time. Do you feel like demons will come through the board? Write that down and talk about your mom. Talk about it first. Do you feel like spirits will be trapped? Do you feel like you could call spirits that you don't ask for? Do you have specific worries, fears, hopes? Write them all down and address them before you get out the Ouija board. I mean, Leila and I have done some crazy things. You know, we've taken a Ouija board to Gallows Hill. We've taken Ouija boards to cemeteries. It's it's all about your mindset going into it. Like Ila said, you know, if if you have a preconceived notion, your mind is going to carry you down that path. Working with with a Ouija board, a spirit board, a witch board is like working with tarot. If you're worried about the demons coming through the board, you should be worried about the demons coming through your tarot, I guess. >> Yeah. And address that. Make a plan to take care of that because your own personal fears can kind of make go weird. Yes. So, address it first. >> But I think, you know, the Florida water thing, obviously, do the things that you would normally do. You know, I keep my my tarot wrapped it with crystals. You know, maybe you want to have some crystals on your board if that's your thing. Or maybe you want to have some incense going while you're while you're working with the board. Um maybe you want to cast a circle and do it within a circle. You know, do whatever it is you normally do when you do divination because that's ultimately what you're doing. >> Yeah. Treat it like divination. I would also say set your intentions ahead of time. Make it sacred. Make it sacred space. Set it up with the intention you're about to call your grandmother, your mother's mother. This is a line. This is a connection. This is your ancestor. Treat it like that. Light the candles. Cast the circle. Not just to have a a sacred container, but to make it a space out of space, a a time out of time, that moment of liinal sacredness. Treat it that way. Bring her favorite perfume, her favorite food, play her favorite music. Whoever you are calling, set the space for that person because that's who you want to come in. Invite them in by setting the stage. >> Great answer, Ila. >> That's all I really recommend. Make sure you have something there to record what you're writing. Be open, ask questions, and and just be ready for the answers to come through. Now, if you feel like you need to be safe, cast the circle first and say goodbye at the end and then dismiss the energies. Say, "We close this circle. By our will, this is done." Be serious. Be solid. And then close it. Close the door. Physically slam a door. If it makes you feel better and helps you actualize that in your magical brain, slam the door and say, "This is done. Be gone." And that's fine. That's all you got to do. There is a board that I occasionally use and I like to keep it in a container. Um, it happens to be like a cloth bag and it's kind of almost like a ritual that when it goes in the bag, it's done and it's sealed. You know, just like when my tarot gets wrapped up in its silk, it's done for the day. You know, you're done. Go to bed now. Um, same concept. So, even if you use the box it came in for that same purpose, you know, kind of have a precreated space where it's like, okay, you're done now. You can go home and rest. We're done speaking here. You You know what I mean? >> I like that. I like that a lot. Yeah. It's It's good to have an ending ritual. Just like you have a beginning of your ritual. It's good to have a this is done and ended ritual. >> Then I recommend eat your food, have a drink, be real, be physical. >> Ground yourself. >> Ground yourself. Be in this world and kind of make sure to disconnect. You know, maybe you can have a feast of of your grandmother's favorite foods with your mom. Talk about your mom's favorite foods growing up. have that connection with her afterwards, but ground in the here and now. >> We hope we answered some good questions for you guys tonight. Leila and I love listener questions, and you know, sometimes we don't always have the the the opportunity to respond to you uh back via email or direct message, but we do try to take the time and gather some up and answer them this way. So, we hope we did the best we could for you folks. >> Before we go, I do want to mention the last time we used a Ouija board We're We're so around and find out. >> At Central New York Pagan Pride, one of our listeners, Hey, >> came up to us and one of the gifts that this lovely person gave us was an old Ouija board. >> You know, some people would be freaked out about that, Ila. >> We were thrilled. I am so jealous that you are currently in possession of it physically that I could die. So, for people who are just like, "Oh my god, that's so scary." I'm jealous that you are the one in physical possession, but it was >> I'm excited about this because we decided to around and find out. And we'll tell you all about this backstory of this nicely haunted Ouija board in our next episode because we took it to a very haunted cemetery that we've been to before that's not that far from my house. >> So, we around. We found out >> we did we had some experiences. We did some pseudo professional read not at all ghost hunting. Your love actually ignored every single piece of advice we gave him. >> He did >> and he made something back to my house. >> Well, yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. >> So, we will talk about our experience with a Ouija board that a listener gave us at a haunted cemetery in an upcoming episode. Thank you all for listening. Thank you all so much for sending in the questions. We do love answering them and it's so nice to answer them in a forum like this where everyone can kind of gain all that knowledge from your wonderful questions. So if you have something that you know maybe you don't know, you're not clear on, you don't know what to do, where to turn, send us your questions and we will answer them as best we can. If not, throw them on the air and answer them live. So reach out to us. We love hearing from you. >> Thank you guys so much and welcome to the season of the witch. Until our next episode, be wise, be wicked, >> and keep it witchy. [Music]

----------------------------------------
Welcome to Back on the Broomstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimmooire, where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots after a long period of mundanity. >> We're rewalking the path of the wise, and trying out all the latest spells, rituals, and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices. >> So, grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron, and your crystals, >> and join us as we get back on the broomstick. Hi and welcome to Back on the Broomstick. I'm Laya and this episode we're going to focus on the magic of numbers, numerology. Where did it come from? Is it too much math for Shell? And do you have to know how to use the Pythagorean theorem in order to use math and numbers in your magic? And I'm Shell and I am not a mathy person. So, this is going to be a challenge for me. But I am a Taylor Swift fan. I'm a Swifty. I don't care. I will admit it. I will die on the sword. And Taylor Swift's into numerology. So, I thought, let's talk numerology. >> Her favorite number is the same as my favorite number, >> 13. >> That's right. So, let's dive right into what is numerology. Where did it come from? >> Let's work our way from the history. Um, because we want folks to have the background, not just, oh, I want to find my numbers, but why are you finding your numbers? >> Why do we even like numbers? Shell doesn't even like numbers. >> I don't like numbers. I don't. >> She does though because honestly whenever you do a chant in circle, how many times do you say it? >> Three times. But that ain't math. >> No, but it is numbers. And if you're going to pick a number to do something on, you know, you're going to pick a three, a five, a seven, or a nine. Am I right? >> Only because I have a reason for picking certain numbers and it they just happen to be in that grouping of numbers, but it's not because they're odd. >> Exactly. So, you don't have to be a math person in order to like numbers. We say third times the charm. We say um seven is a lucky number. Or some people think 13 is an unlucky number. >> And some people think what you put out gets sent back to you three times. >> That's right. Because numbers are so entwined with our history, with the universe and and with life itself. We are fascinated with them and we have been since time began. We don't really know who invented numbers because we all count. everybody counts and and numbers were kind of invented in India and within Islam and the Arab countries. So kind of a lot of different places developed the actual concept of numbers at the same time. >> When did we start to care about sequences and things that came up? >> Right from the beginning, people have always thought that that was magical and they started to use numbers to keep track of the stars and the seasons and they thought these were mystical events. And so numbers themselves had divine properties. In Babylon, in ancient Egypt, they tracked the moon and the stars and they used numbers to create the pyramids, right? So all these mystical magical things. And about 600 B.CE in Greece, we've got the philosopher Pythagoras. Now, we've heard of the Pythagorean theorem, right? A^2 + B²= C^². And this is the guy that came up with that. But he came up with that not because he wanted to torture middle school students. No, he did. >> Yeah. Okay. He probably did. But also because he felt that numbers were tied to the cosmos, to the cycles of the universe, to the gods themselves. And so he linked them to music and to the truth of your spirit, to your soul. I I mean, this guy thought numbers were in everything. And and I kind of believe that, too. >> You know, there always really has been a a mystical and divine relationship between numbers and events. The only reason I'm saying this is because we've said it before on air. I turned 50 this year. You know, I know people are like, "Oh, it's just a number. It's just a birthday." Blah blah blah blah blah. But like 50 for me not liking math and not being a numbers person. 50, you know, and I did the same thing when I was 25. I was like, "Oh, I'm 25. How many people go drinking when they're 21? How many people get a license at 16?" You know, it's everything. I feel like as much as I am not a numbers and math person, I have come to realize doing research for this episode that I feel like everything I do revolves around numbers. Even, you know, and you taught me this trick. You know, I've been traveling the last couple of weeks and various grocery stores in various towns and various states. I can even get a discount with Jenny. >> Jenny's number. >> Put in your local area code in 8675309 and you're getting that store discount. All right, hold on. We have to explain this to people because this is a wonderful witchy tip. So, side note, we're going to go on a little tangent, folks. It still has to do with numbers. So, a couple years ago, we went down to Sacred Space and we went into a grocery store and realized that in order to get the very good deal on some groceries we were going to get for our weekend at this festival, you had to have a store loyalty card. >> Who has a store loyal loyalty card in Baltimore? Not these two girls. Not us. So I taught Shell that you take from the old song Jenny. You would take Jenny's number 8675309 what Gen Xer doesn't know that number and you add the local area code to it and there's a good chance that someone in that area has signed up that number for the loyalty card. I didn't believe you. So here I am at the damn checkout googling what's the area code for Baltimore, Maryland. So we type it in. Your card has been accepted. I'm like no way. So then I go somewhere else without you and I'm like, "Okay, Leila's full of it. This was a fluke. Big city." I type it in. Sure is sugar. I got the club discount. It's real. >> It is. So there you go. There's your mundane magical number trick. If you need a loyalty card, use Jenny's phone number plus the local area code. >> If you're not old enough to know Jenny's number, we are not judging you. Google it. It's It's a cute song, but it'll stay in your head. Don't listen to it. Anyway, back to our regular schedule program. So, lots of cultures and places have come up with numbers because they are so magical, because they are in everything. Everything in our life revolves around numbers. And in China, the Iching, it's an ancient divination system that relies on numbers. Numbers there were seen as reflections of cosmic balance. And in the Cabala, which is a huge one, especially today, a lot of tarot, a lot of esoteric practices today use the ancient Cabala, which is a numerical system that assigns numbers to letters in the Hebrew alphabet. Now, this is different. A little later in the episode, we're going to talk about how to find like your soul number and your name number and things like that. And the way we're going to use that by assigning numbers to letters is not what I'm talking about here. The one we'll talk about later is the Pythagorean system. So we've got the cabalistic and Pythagorean ways of looking at numbers and their magical relationship to letters and meanings. But the Cabala, the letters double as numbers. So words and names can have numerical values and it's a very magical system. And that's why you'll see a lot of this in the Golden Dawn. You'll see Alistister Crowley used a lot of the Cabala. >> But if you can, can you explain to me and actually I had this conversation with my boss this evening. Hey buddy, why are the numbers in the numerology system not the same as Cabala and in all the other systems? Why why can't one mean the same damn thing in everything? Do you know? >> Because the the Hebrew alphabet is different than our alphabet. It's literally that simple. >> Literally that simple. Uh like each major arcana card like align with a Hebrew letter. So like the fool is alf, which is the number one, right? So it's kind of the same. Alf, the Hebrew letter alf is one, which corresponds to the fool card, but the full zero. Let me explain. There's technically no symbol for zero in cabala. There is the concept of nothing but no symbol for it. So in the cabala the letter alf or the number one is the beginning. It's the divine spark that starts everything right. So in that way it matches the energy of the fool. Even though the fool is numbered zero in tarot magically it's the one the first card or alf in cabala. Okay. Okay. Is zero a number in numerology? >> It is. It is. But zero came later. So zero existing as a number is a little bit esoteric. Uh the idea has always been around you know the concept of nothingness but other than placeholder symbols occasionally or maybe a glyph to represent the idea that there's nothing here there was no number symbol until Indian mathematicians first did it and then later Arab mathematicians added it in. But that was like in the fifth century BCE I think. I'd have to double check. Prior to the 19th century, numerology was actually called, and y'all know I'm bad at pronunciations, so forgive me. Before the 20th century, numerology was referred to as arithmancy, which sounds super mathy. It's basically arithmetic stuck with the mansy. So, I think that maybe that could have been when some changes were made. You know, when when spiritualism came about and and when all that stuff started ramping up in the late 1800s is probably I'm guessing when it went from arithmancy, arymancy to numerology. >> Yeah. a lot of the spiritualists at that time uh there was a couple women in particular that used numerology and the cabala and ideas like that in spirituality and so they kind of brought them together and you're exactly right that's when it started to get into Christianity when they started to have a lot of interest in numbers and in magical numbers and mystical numbers happened at about that same time but I would say that our modern idea and our modern witchy fascination with numbers came directly from the LMA, the Golden Dawn, Alistister Cwley, and the Wiccan ideas that came later like the number three being sacred. It's part of the triple goddess, the triple god, triple phases of the moon, which is a little simplistic, but you know, so we have these ideas that and that's where that kind of came from. >> And also for me, when I think of the three, I think of the sun, the moon, and the stars. >> So that's the history. But in modern times, I would say that I was never told this is numerology. But everyone always told me that the numbers 3, five, and 9 had a lot of spirituality, had a lot of magical associations. >> I I remember as a child also being told that 7, 13, and 11 were bad luck. Don't know why, but apparently 7, 11, and 13, according to my grandma, no good. That could have been, you know, a a a folk superstition, but there are people that have numbers that whether it's for them or or what have you that they feel are not good numbers in their life. >> Yeah, I know that seven that was that's one I've heard a lot as well. Like my grandmother would talk about like the seventh son of the seventh son or seven degrees of initiation, right? >> Seven degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon. Seven's considered to be mystical in a lot of systems. And part of that is because it's a prime number. A lot of these magical numbers are odd numbers. 3 5 7 9. And seven is one of them. It's only divisible by itself. And one, you know, mathematically it's just a little bit weird. So that doesn't really fit. And so that gives it kind of the air of it's different. It's special. It's magical. >> Everything mathematically is weird. >> There you go. That's true, too. No, they're all very neat. Math is very neat and precise, and that's one of the things I like about it. But, you know, there's seven planets, seven days of the week, seven chakras in the body. Seven's like the spiritual quest number. It's the seekers number. Seven has has a a lot of folklore tied to it. Because of that, 13, I know, is like the Friday the 13th. Isn't that when the Knights Templar, Friday the 13th, the Knights Templar were betrayed? Right. So that kind of started that supposedly. But yeah, so there's a lot of connotations that people have with numbers and some can be very personal. I tend to gravitate to my birthday numbers. If I am going to do like mega or powerball, you know, I always use like my birthday, my kids birthdays, you know, an anniversary date. But that's how people do things like that. You know how many people use theirs or their children's birthday or use numbers as part of their passwords? Everything is just so number associated and you don't realize it and I guess I didn't realize it until all of this. And when I started to look at some of the the numerology meanings for the numbers, first my mind had a hard time because I'm used to numbers in tarot mean this and you know if you get the four card it means that you know so it took a minute to wrap my head around it but I almost kind of like it now dare I say. And if you tell me to start doing math and journaling I am going to jump through this Zoom screen and get you. I'm not I'm just going to again point out that the number meanings for each system aren't very much different from each other. The core meanings are fairly consistent. Although I would say that Cabala is most often the outlier as far as meanings go. Um you brought up four and that's stability and structure in both tarot and Pythagorean systems, but it's more like expansion in Cabala. So similar but not really. Um, so sometimes the connections between systems are a stretch, but like one is a beginning no matter what system you look at. Like most things, you should find the system that makes sense to you and works best with your particular magical brain. >> All right, so I want to jump in real quick to what everybody's thinking in their mind. What are my numbers and what do they mean? How do I get my numbers? Which numbers do I work on? Add, subtract, multiply, divide. First of all, there is no multiplication in numerology. Love it. >> By numerology, you're talking about a a specific thing like finding your birth number or finding your name or something like that, >> right? So, let's say, for example, I wanted to find my life path number. And your life path number kind of outlines your life, I guess, is the best way to put it. So, this is to use numbers as a fortune-telling device by going by your date of birth and your name and stuff. >> You know, these aren't like this says that you have a perpetuity to get walked all over. That doesn't mean you're going to let everybody walk all over you your whole life. That just means you got to be cognizant of it. >> So, one part of numerology is using numbers to define your future. Some people believe that there are numbers kind of like astrology at the time that you were born, the date that you were born, and then fate like the name that you were given. All of these things can be reduced to a singledigit number or in some cases a two-digit number. And that number can be a key basically to unlocking the secrets of your life, the secrets of who you are, what your personality is like, what your future is going to be like. Much like astrology, I would say tarot cards, but tarot can change. And astrology tends to be set at the time of your birth. And this is also something >> kind of set. Yeah, these are kind of set. I mean, you were born when you were born. You have the name, you have I mean, they're pretty set. >> All right. I don't know all of these. And you kind of shocked me at the beginning and I'm super excited to learn how to do them. So, >> all right. So, your life path, you are going to take your full birth date. >> Okay. Month, day, and full year. Right. whole year. >> I'm got it. I'm writing it down. Okay. You add them all together, left to right. >> You add them all together, left to right. I added all of my numbers and came up with 31. Now, you have to get it down to a single number. Unless it's 11, 22, or 33, and we'll talk about that in a minute. >> Hold, please. I'm going to do some math. >> I did my month, my day, and my full year. I came up with 31 which is ironic because my birthday is on the 31st and then I add the three and the one together because you have to reduce it down and I get four. So my life path number is four. Okay. So this is the Pythagorean system basically reduces the numbers down to one single number and each of those has a specific meaning and that that can be applied to all sorts of things. So interestingly Shell my life path number is also four. You know why? Because we're besties. >> That's why. So, what does four mean? >> Okay. So, according to this particular method, which again, you know, different methods, different people have different um ideas of what the numbers mean, but according to this method, it means foundations, the salt of the earth. I have also seen it mean the builder, foundations, the person who stabilizes things, building legacy, work ethic, force. Think of like a chair, you know, the four legs of something. You know, if you have four pillars, you're pretty stable. You're pretty solid. >> I also look at it as the steady hand within the chaos. >> Oo, yeah. Again, that stabilizer. I love that. >> So, the next one, this is your soul urge number. Your core urges and desires. >> Whoa. Okay. I've never heard of this before. Okay. Soul urge. So, this is what like you want. is this is what your soul is urging to do. >> Correct. Correct. >> For your soul urge, what you do is you use all of the vowels in your full birth name. >> Okay. So, you take your birth name and you write down just the vowels in it. >> You're going to use your middle name. So, first, middle, last, >> and then you take the Pythagorean system again. You write down the numbers 1 through nine in a line. And then underneath each you start writing the alphabet and when you get to nine you go to the next line. So each number will have three or sometimes two letters associated with it. We'll show pictures of that and we'll have links to that in the show notes so you can see it. But again it's basically assigns three letters roughly to each number 1 through nine. So A is 1, E is 5, I is 9, O is 6, and U is three. So, we'll put this again all in the show notes, but so you just take the vowels out of your full birth name, first, middle, last, and then what do you do, Shell? >> I did all of my numbers, all my vowels, and I came up with 11. >> I just did mine and it's 33. >> Okay, perfect. Perfect. So, I'm going to stop right there and I'm going to interject something. >> Okay, >> now with the life path, remember I told you if you have a double digit, you add them together. >> Yes. You do not do that with 11,22 and 33. And here is why. >> Oh, okay. >> 11,22 and 33 are considered a master number. And it says that they possess intensified vibrations and have a more significant spiritual purpose. For me, 11 is the spiritual messenger or the illuminator. What' you say yours was? 33. >> 33. >> That one is the master teacher. um considered the most potent and it actually amplifies the energies of both 11 and 22 as well. >> No wonder we're besties. All right. Okay. >> 33 is also the number of divine love, spiritual guidance, and profound compassionate service to humanity. Dude, that's like you in a nutshell. >> Thank you. I think >> what mine means is 11 um is the number known for heightened intuition, spiritual insight, deep connections to the unseen and represents the bridge between the spiritual and the material. I feel that. I feel that. The next one I want to mention is going to be your birth number. That is just your day. Just your day. So I was born on the 31st. I have to add three and one. My birth my birth number is four again. >> Oh, so your life path number is your full birth day month day here and your birth number is just the day you were born >> only the day. If you were born from the 1st through the 9th, keep your number. If you were born from the the 10th to the 31st, you need to add your two numbers together. What if they're born on the 29th and they have an 11? Do they keep adding and they go to two? >> If they were born on the 29th, they would add it to 11 and that's their number. If they were born on the 11th, that's their number. If they were born on the 22nd, that's their number because it's a master number. >> What numbers do you add down to one? And what numbers do you not add down to one? >> You do not add down to one. 11, 22, or 33 >> ever. everything else you do. >> Correct. >> So in the Pythagorean system, it's 1 through 9 unless it's 11, 22, or 33. >> Correct? >> Okay. All right. I got you. So I'm one. >> You're one and I'm four. >> Okay. >> And according to that, one means beginnings or primal force. You are a primal force >> sometimes. >> Then you have your personality number. >> Oh, this is one. I know the personality number and soul urge number are like two parts of a whole thing, right? The soul urge is the vowels of your birth name and the personality number is all the consonants of your name and add them together. So the two of those kind of give you a whole picture. So, you have to go back to your chart where you have the 1 through nine and you you have the the alphabet associated to each number and you literally and I have the longest damn name. So, when I add mine up, you get 13. And so, I have to add the three and the one right back to four. My personality number is 11. When we were talking earlier, you said 11 here means visionary, highly psychic and intuitive as well as a healer and an old soul. >> Correct. So another one is your destiny number. And to do that, you add up the Pythagorean number for all the letters of your birth name. So your birth date gives you your life path number, the road of fate that you'll walk in your life. And your destiny number, which is created from your birth name, tells you how you'll walk that path and with what personality. And the idea here is that nothing's random. The date of your birth is fixed and it tells you who you are a lot like astrology does. Your name though, even if it seems like it's random, is more like a spell that's cast on you either with intention, you know, chosen for its numerology or usually without. But unlike your date of birth, your name is changeable. I like to think of your birth name as like your soul's original spell. It's like the original spell that was put on your fate. But later in your life, you might have a nickname or you might choose a new name or give yourself a new name or a magical name. And by choosing that new name, I feel like you are giving yourself a new spell, a a new destiny maybe. And it's a vibration that you are choosing. It's a destiny of your choice. Uh married names, titles, they kind of add into that as well. It I feel that it does kind of change how you're walking that path. might not change your destiny, but it changes how you walk the path. >> I have a lot of foundations in the salt of the earth in my life. I feel >> there you go. Two more numerology calculations you can do. There's one called the universal year number. And the universal year number is just adding the numbers of that year. So, you know, 2025 equals 9. So, this year, our universal year number is 9. If I flip back to my little chart here and go to nine, nine is wisdom. So I think this is the year we as as a population need to work on gaining wisdom. I didn't figure out 2026 yet. That would be 10. So that would be one. So next year would actually beginnings kind of sounds appropriate. So yeah, universal year number. You're just adding the numbers of the current year. Now, this one I really found fun. Your attitude number, the month and day of your date of birth. Now, people send me birthday cards so they know my birthday. So, I did 0531 and I got nine. So, >> mine's three. >> My attitude number is wisdom. >> Nice. What's three? >> Three. >> February 1st, 21. >> Creativity. >> Very nice. Very nice. again. Totally you. >> What's this one overarching? What's this one? In control of >> attitude. >> Oh, your attitude. Okay, very interesting. >> Maybe for wisdom, mine really means I should think before I speak. >> Or maybe it just means you're very wise. So the point here is you can find all these numbers. You can use your name, you can use your birth name, you can use your chosen name, and you can find what this means according to a system. Now, here's the fun thing. >> What? >> Just like anything, there are accepted meanings. There are traditional meanings of numbers. Then there's different system meanings. There's the Iching. There's the Cabala. There's the Pythagorean system. You're going to find different people ascribe different meanings to different numbers. Maybe your birth number means something entirely different than the Cabala says it does. That's okay. >> In some numerologists, not all, I found a couple sources that also have what's called power numbers. So, remember we talked about master numbers 11, 22, 33. Some folks go by power numbers that are 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99. The theory is the consecutiveness, you know, 1 22 33 3 4 5 66. So they're saying 44 on are considered high power numbers. I think you would only get those types of numbers if you were doing like a destiny one or or something like that where you're adding like you know like I said mine came to 94. >> Maybe you start adding your name and your lover's name to see what your destiny is together. >> Right? >> Numbers are symbols basically. That's all a number is a symbol. It is a symbol. It's a sigil that we have given to an idea. Four shows up a lot around you. We talked about fours being stability like a chair. Eights look like an infinity symbol. So, it kind of follows that. 33. We like threes and threes and nines. That's that's a very round magical mother number. So, you start to look at them more as symbols and sigils rather than numbers. And so when you start to repeat them and you see them repeated over and over again, you see 111 or 1111 or 333, that's because our brains like patterns and we find power in that pattern. Whenever you repeat something, it gives it more power. And also our brains like patterns. They latch on to them. They're going to notice them more. And so that again gives it more power. >> Well, that brings me to something I just want to also briefly mention. Let me take you back to the '9s. Remember the '9s? >> I do. >> So, back in the 1990s, a new numerology thing kind of came about and has gained traction ever since. And that's angel numbers. And angel numbers again started in 1990s essentially. But what they are is three consecutive numbers. You know, 111, 222, 333, 444. Why they're called angel numbers, I still don't know, not going to lie. >> Well, you mentioned the 90s. So, back in the 80s, there was the satanic panic and and there was definitely a surge towards fluffy things. People liked angels. They liked the idea of purity and goodness. And so, the idea of triple something, I think Christianity likes their 666 and their 777. They like their triples. So I think anytime you would see numbers in triplicate, people kind of assigned that to a Christian angel thing, >> right? >> Basically what angel numbers are is repeating or patterned number sequences like 111, 222, etc. And people interpret those as spiritual messages, which I think they are. They're called angel numbers because the idea is that it comes from the angels, but it can really be the universe, your spirit guides, maybe your higher consciousness. Using numbers as a simple universal language to send you information. Our brains love patterns. So seeing the same thing over and over again is a really good way to get the attention of your subconscious and to get you to pay attention to the message. Now people like repetition and we notice that and sometimes it is a sign and sometimes it's the beter minehoff effect. We've talked about that before. It's the blue car effect. It's when you have an idea in your head and then suddenly you start seeing it everywhere. >> Everywhere, >> right? So it's frequency bias. Basically the frequency of that has not increased. You noticing it has increased. And that's what that is. That doesn't mean that it's not magical. If your brain has an increased awareness of something, there's probably a reason why. If you keep noticing 555 on the clock, what what does fives mean in the Pythagorean system? >> Change a dynamic force, >> right? So, if you keep seeing 555, maybe that's your higher mind trying to tell you that it's time for a change. You know, there could be a reason for that. So just because there's a scientific reason why you keep seeing it that confirmation bias doesn't mean there's not a magical reason behind it as well. But you know I I I agree with all that. But I also want to say and you and I kind of talked about this a little bit before we started recording. There are numbers that come up in people's lives that don't translate out to that definition or that grouping of definitions. And an example of that is I was telling you earlier tonight, I have a four-digit number that I always see. I see it on clocks. I I've seen it on billboards. I'll be driving, see it on license plate. And that particular fourdigit number happens to be associated with my childhood address. So because of that number, I wouldn't break it down to the the one-digit thing because that particular number as is has meaning to me. But because it only has meaning to me, I'm the only one who can figure out what it means. Yeah. But seeing number patterns is not the same as numerology formulas. There's no reducing these to a single digit. Seeing repeated number patterns are essentially messages. They're information that your higher self, your guides, your deities, maybe the universe is trying to give you. And because they're messages, they're highly personal to each individual. That's why you keep seeing your birthday or your or your childhood address. And that's why context is absolutely key when it comes to interpreting these. Numbers are just like any other symbol or sigil. They are going to have their archetypal meaning. They're going to have the meanings that a lot of people over history keep over and over giving to it. Again, four being foundational because of a chair. It's very simple to grasp those similar meanings. But when you see a repeated number, you have to ask yourself a lot of questions like Shell did. She sees this number and knows, "Oh, wow. That's the same number as my childhood home. That has a lot of symbolism to me." So, she immediately knew what that was. If you don't, you have to think, well, what was I thinking of when I saw it? What does it remind me of? When I say this number, what's my immediate feeling? So, you're going to journal that stuff. Haha. You're going to write down when you >> couldn't help yourself, could you? I can't. >> You couldn't get through one episode without saying freaking journaling. >> Exactly. So, you want to look for the pattern. What's the pattern here? Is it always every day at 3:33? What are you doing at that time of day? What are you thinking? what's associated with it. So, magically, that's how you're going to use this beta minehoff principle to help your magical witchy life. But I I I think that it is best to kind of feel out what each number might mean to you. When I think of tarot, as the major arcana goes up, it's kind of a you're at the beginning and you're moving up the ladder. So, you know, if my numbers four, got a lot of fours, I haven't made it to the end yet. you know, I keep working, keep chugging cuz I kind of look at it as a progression, but I must at least once a week see my birthday. You know, I I actually joke to my sweet love. We'll be doing something and I'll just happen to look at the clock and I'll be like, "Oh, it's birthday time." Only I can figure out why I always see my birthday time, you know? So, some of this you just got to the books aren't going to tell you. The internet isn't going to tell you. You and I aren't going to tell them. Sometimes you just got to think, what does this number mean to me? And what do I glean when I meditate on this number? When I think of this number, you know, am I looking at nine as wrapping things up, closure? This time of year is a good nine time of year. You know, we're getting to that point where we're getting ready to kind of burst into a new season. I say that like it's almost spring. I'm hoping. Here >> it is spring in the southern hemisphere. You lucky dogs. >> We love you guys, by the way. You warm people as we're freezing. But what five means to me might be a little different because I was born in May, you know, five is my birth month. So that has a different meaning than maybe whatever a book says, you know. So, you got to really kind of put, as anything else, put your own intuition and your own thoughts and and and feelings into what do these numbers mean to you? You know, I had a conversation at my witchie store job tonight and I was saying that we were going to talk about numerology and, you know, we got into this whole conversation about there's so many different systems with so many different meanings. Go with your gut. What does four mean to you? What does four mean to me? You got a eight. What does eight mean to you? You know, are you almost done with with this chapter? Ready to start a new? These things are very personal. Astrology kind of cut and dry. Tarot kind of cut and dry. I feel that numerology isn't as cut and dry. And I disagree. I think it is very cut and dry. I think there is wiggle room. Just as with any symbol-based divination system, you do have to add your own personal meanings to them. But I think numbers are numbers. 4 plus 4 always equals 8. Numbers are precise. It It's part of their very nature. So I believe that their magical meanings also tend to be precise. There's room for personal interpretation just as there is in everything. >> The meaning of the numbers. >> Yeah, I agree. The meaning has to fit with the witch. Like 333 might mean something totally different to you than it does to me. And I get that. But this is just going to be one of the things we disagree just a little bit on. I think the numbers have their own power. They have their own magic because three things is always three things. And I think that translates over into the magical world as well. So yes, I agree with you. You should write down your own personal meanings. But I do think that there's going to be these universal meanings that are going to also come through at the same time along with your personal meanings and your personal feelings. >> I hear you. I hear you. I just don't think that you could take a four and give it a personal meaning that has no connection whatsoever to its inherent meaning. I feel that it will always have some qualities that are part of what the number four is in the mundane world. There's just too much foundational about four for you to say it it always just means dreams. I don't know. I just think that the essence of the number, the soul of the number is always going to magically come through in some way, even if it has its own connotations for each individual person. >> I I hear that. But what if four to me means almost like getting to an evaluation period? You know, you're looking at at 1 through nine. You know, four or fiveish is kind of halfway. What if I look at four as kind of a a middle ground? let me reassess what I've done. >> No, that's exactly what it is because that's what the that's inherent in the number. That's what I'm saying is is your personal meaning still matches what the number inherently is. >> But how I don't feel like that's stability. I don't know. >> Okay. Four means to you that evaluation period before you move ahead. And that is exactly stability. That's that same meaning. That's establishing a stable foundation on something before moving forward. So honestly, we don't disagree that much. I mean, all I'm saying is that the numbers have power all their own that is not dimmed just because it also has a personal meaning. >> And this is what happens when you get me talking about mathy stuff. I think we're kind of saying the same thing, but what can we do with numbers? So, numbers as sigils and meanings aside, like what are some ways other than the formulas to figure out like your life path number? You know what's another way that you could use a magical number in spellwork or in ritual? >> Well, you know, ritual, first thing that comes to mind, don't forget when you're cast in your circle, you got four quarters to call. Again, back to four. I also see four as a balance. And I see it as a balance because of quarters. You know, earth, air, fire, water. You know, you got the the the up and down and the left and the right. You're you're making that that solid cross. Again, that stability. Not that the quarters look like chair legs, >> but still stable, >> right? They they cross each other and create stability for each other. And without one, if you only had three, you screw that balance. So, I kind of look at it as like a stable balancing thing. So, one thing you could do with that four is you could pick four crystals to carry with you to help you with that balance. You could pull four tarot cards and position them in a balanced way and read them and see about that. >> In in my particular coven, we on occasion, not you know, not that we're like out in the middle of huge open space, but we do we do a dance and we do it three times around. You know, you and I have done done rituals where, you know, you and I don't always like to conform to the norm. We've done some things nine times, >> right? >> Instead of three. >> Doing things nine times when it's in a small intimate magical working where it's just you and me or just you and me and a few other witches doing some deep magical workings. Doing something nine times that's powerful. That's energy building. But man, when you're in a group of like 30, 50 people, doing something nine times can be very difficult. >> Monotonous. >> That's right. So yeah, it's it's also, you know, setting dependent, but yeah, maybe you need that maybe you need that ending cycle, right? Maybe you need that nine energy or maybe nine is something very personal to you. Maybe nine is the number of your maybe that's the day your love was born was on the 9th and so you want to do something nine times to associate with their birth to maybe that's your tag lock with them or maybe maybe that number shares some significance like an anniversary or something and so you're bringing that number nine in in a very personal way to add that energy to your working >> you know again you know four it always comes back to my damn life you know me and my sweet love we we joke about how we're connected by four. And what we mean by that is I was born on the 31st 31 and he was born on the 13th 1 3 1 3 is 4 3 1 is 4 and when we add together the date that we met it comes down to four. >> Ah yes the power of repeated numbers patterns not just repetitions are also magical. And there is a numerical pattern that is so profound, it's found over and over again in nature. And that's the Fibonacci spiral. Going back to sacred space, we did the whole fool's journey on the on the spiral, walking the Fibonacci spiral meditation, the Fibonacci spiral is a very simple mathematical equation where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. 1 + 1 is 2. 2 + 1 is 3. 3 + 2 is 5. And you keep going and that number keeps going around. And if you plot those numbers, it creates a spiral. And the fun thing about the Fibonacci spiral is you will find this ratio, this spiral in nature over and over and over again. It's found in the curve of a sea shell, the spiral of a galaxy, the curl of a wave, the roundness of your baby's cheek. I mean, it's everywhere. This number makes up life itself. It makes up the whole world. You know, numbers are inherently part of everything that you see. And these patterns are part of that. So patterns like you said like the 31 and the 13, you know, that mirrors each other and that can mean something too. Seeing these repeated or mirrored just like in any other kind of thing, mirror magic has something. You guys are two halves of a whole or or reflecting each other. You balance each other. You can bring all sorts of meaning to that as well. >> Now, you asked me ways that I would use this numbers in in spellwork and ritual, and you earlier mentioned music. You threw me into a drum circle when we were at Pagan Pride Day, which actually I appreciate. >> Yeah, honestly, thank you, Max. And CNY Pagan Pride, that was magical. >> Music is all about numbers. And I I was, you know, I was raised in a super magic m musical family and I picked up that drum and you know, you listen to the the lead drummer so you can kind of tune in to to the beat. >> You got to find the one >> and >> they even call it that. They call it finding the one. >> Oh, I found the one real quick, but you're going to laugh when I say this. I was doing it in eights. They played a tune for a little while that you and I are very familiar with and I remember it because it's eight beats. It is. You're gonna laugh. Calcul is the rhythm. Calcul is the rhythm. So I go by that eight. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4. And that's how I keep the rhythm because I know it's eight beats and I count the eight in my head. Eight beats, start over. Eight beats, start over. >> Exactly. Absolutely. And that's part of the reason why I think drumming for me can be so magical because I do like that counting. I do like that rhythm and it gets everybody synced up. When you have a rhythm like that, when you have some steady beat, steady counting or steady chanting, it can help everyone get synced up and get into the same space. And when I jumped in and was drumming with Max and everyone from CNY, Pagan Pride, and you guys jumped in and were drumming, you could feel that energy flowing around these people, some of whom had never been to a pagan drum circle or any type of drum circle in their lives. And we all connected and you could feel the energy of each other. And that's powerful magic right there. I found myself going back to my high school bandandy days because yes, I was a bandandy. And that is how I used to do it, reading sheet music. I would count the notes to keep track with the rest of the band. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. That's why playing music is is part of that number magic and and can add so many different layers to your spellworker ritual just by tapping a little rhythm on your legs. You know, again, find a number that matches with your intention with what you're trying to draw in or direct out and find a way to incorporate that number into your spellwork. Add seven stones, add seven candles, tap out a seven count beat on your legs for the spell. There's so many ways you can do that. >> It's still mathy. >> It is, but it's fun. And you know, you know, it's it's funny how how many times we use it without even thinking about it. And you know, that's kind of what this whole process has brought to light to me because you know me, you start talking math and I run for the hills, but I'm like, wait, I always see these numbers and you know, like with the drumming, I counted out the drumming. You know, we always make sure we do the four quarters. You know, we do things in three, you know, I was like, I kind of use numerology and didn't even know it. >> Yeah. Yeah. We use it all the time. We might not be doing it in divination. Although I will admit it's kind of fun to go through and see what your numbers are and kind of where your life path is going. We all like those divinations, right? That's definitely fun to do. >> Well, and you know, speaking of divination, if you go back to older tarot that was based off of playing cards, you know, you had to know there wasn't no pictures. You had a a card with a five of hearts on it. What's that mean? Yeah, the pip cards had no pictures until Pixie, Pamela Coleman, Smith really illustrated them. So, yeah, that can definitely uh help strengthen your numerology. That's for sure. >> So, I think my brain is about full of math. How about you? >> If I have to put one more number in my head, it will explode. So, we've dived into how many things are the same with numbers, how many systems are different, and that personality and your own life can absolutely add a layer of meaning to each number and how you use them in your practice. Numbers are scary to me, but I I really encourage folks to even if you're not going to deep dive this, definitely go down the rabbit hole of numerology because it's interesting even if you only touch on it. And it's definitely a puzzle piece that can add a lot of layers and a lot of energy to your spellwork and to your ritual work. Another layer, another step to to make things more powerful when you're trying to work your will. Thank you guys so much for listening to this episode of Back on the Broomstick. Don't forget to get your letters into our P.O. box if you want to enter our season of the witch giveaway. It has to be postmarked by October 1st, so you've got a little bit of time. >> Time's a ticking, people. >> Shell is having a blast opening up the mailbox all the time. >> Oh my god. Can I just say this so all the listeners know that I went out and spent like a week with you. So, you know, no one's checking the PO box cuz I'm not here. I went to the PO box after being away. So, I go to the box and then I had to go to the counter cuz I had to pick some stuff up that was too big for the box. You know what the lady at the the post office said to me? >> What? >> I'm really sorry, ma'am. I wish I had a bag for you >> because she knows I she knows I walked two blocks and there was so much mail. And guys, you don't even realize how happy you make Leila and I with your your cards, your letters, your gifts, your postcards. Like, I literally go back to work and stop all of my work cuz that's not the priority at the moment. Text Ila, send pictures to Ila, and I'm like, "Oh my god, we got all these letters." Oh, like we are like giddy school kids. And as much as you guys love us, please know that we absolutely adore all of you equally as much. >> Thank you guys so much. We have so much fun spending time with you every week and for coming out to Central New York Pagan Pride. We're going to have to do a solarium and talk about it because we met so many of you. We got so many hugs. Thank you all. Thank you for everything. Thanks for hanging out with us. And you know, speaking of of meeting folks at Central New York Pagan Pride Day, if you got a selfie with us, post it in the fan discussion group. We'd love to see them. >> All right, we could talk about this forever. What we agree on, what we disagree on, all of the things. But we're going to get going and get working on next week's episode. So, we're going to go be witchy. >> And we're suggesting that all you witches out there, go check out your life number. Do a little math in honor of Shell and Leila. And back on the broomstick >> and then go journal it. >> There you go. All right. So, while you're doing your math, be wise, be wicked, and guys, keep it witchy and be mathy.

----------------------------------------
Hey listeners, just a heads up before this episode.
Our conversation with Nesbosh gets a little dark.
It gets a little deep, kind of like this time of year.
You know, it is the dark part of the year.
We are in the dark season.
And it is time to do that dark work, that deep work,
and have those dark conversations.
And tonight we are going to have one of those dark conversations.
So we just wanted you to prepare yourself.
Welcome to Back on the Brumstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimoire.
Where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots
after a long period of mundanity.
We're re-walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells,
rituals, and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices.
So grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron, and your crystals.
And join us as we get Back on the Brumstick.
Welcome to Back on the Brumstick.
I'm Leila.
And for this episode, we are sitting down with Nesbosh,
the author of Sacred Bones, Magic Bones,
Stories from the Path of Bones,
Nesbosh is also a shamaness and priestess,
and founder and head of many, many pagan groups,
including the covenant of the waters, the temple of Astarte,
and the goddess community, Scotland.
I'm Shella, and we actually met Nesbosh's sacred space,
which is a fabulous conference we've talked about in the past.
But it was such a pleasure to meet you.
And I think the first thing that pointed me out to you
was that beautiful, long, dark hair,
and then sacred bones, magic bones.
Leila's a bone girl, and that immediately drew me to you
because you and Leila have this bone thing.
I'm very afraid of bones.
I don't know what it is.
I'll look at it and I don't like to touch them.
But we ended up having nice conversation.
We hung out at Sacred Space, and we had a lovely time.
So we are so glad that you can join us today, Nes.
And if you could just tell us a little bit about yourself
and tell our listeners a little bit about you.
Well, thank you for having me.
It was such a gift to meet you and everyone in Sacred Space.
And I was also wonderful to share also one of my workshops.
With Leila.
So as you said, you know, I am a shamaness and a priestess.
I'm Ivarian.
I'm from the Ivarian Peninsula.
I'm Spanish.
But I lived in Scotland, where I am, as you said,
from the member of the Goddess Community Scotland.
And I'm a mom.
I got three beautiful children.
Two of them, quite young.
So they keep me with me.
I try to work and write in between and teach and do the things I do.
And I also study.
I'm a student in the university.
I'm a study archaeology.
Focus.
Makes a lot of sense.
Focus in on the archaeology of ritual.
Mainly.
It seems like archaeology fits you like a glove.
Speaking of archaeology and in your fascination with bones,
your wonderful book about bones.
And again, Leila will put all the links in the show notes to your books,
to your website, your socials.
But we are at the time of year where bones are our big part of ritual.
And the sister work is becoming a big part of this seasonal ritual time.
So we want to start and talk a little bit about bones,
a little bit about ancestors.
My first question, and this is what I always say to Leila,
why work with bones?
What is the connection we are getting by working with bones?
Can we start there?
Absolutely.
I mean, we start where you want.
And I think that's a wonderful question, actually.
Why bones?
If, you know, in my book, I talk about both animal and human bones.
Okay?
And I speak about how bones are a gift of connection.
The bones embody the energy of the animal, the human,
that once was held by those bones.
So I do believe that bones are that very special container of spirit.
I love that you called it a container of spirit.
That's a very cool way to put it.
Yeah.
And obviously, I'm not the only one that thinks that because back in the day,
you know, in history, our own ancestors worshiped bones.
You know, they look after the bones of their ancestors.
You know, they worshiped them.
They look after them.
They did rituals for them.
You know, they carry them around.
The mommies, you know, like fetish.
You know, they moved from one place to the other.
There are some tribes actually used to carry their mommies of their ancestors with them.
It's like, no, you're coming with me.
You belong to me.
I belong to you.
So you come with me, whatever I go.
And all the cultures used to bully their ancestors in the earth, you know, the earth, in the kitchens, you know.
And so obviously, the humanity has been aware of that power of the bones, of that magic of the bones.
You know, we can look at bones as a magic box, you know, they contain that spirit.
And that's why they're so special.
I was going to say as much as I say, I don't like bones.
Now you've kind of brought to light why I have a big container of both of my children's baby teeth.
Yes.
And that was something that I was going to mention is that even before we knew that bones contained our DNA,
that you can tell the history of where someone was from and what their diet was.
And even how they lived and how they died by their bones by this magical record of who we are.
We also know that it reaches back through our DNA.
But even before we knew all that scientifically, our ancestors created all these rituals around.
Like you were saying, Ness, honoring the bones, as someone passed, we have all these funeral rights and all these rituals,
where the bones are honored and kept in some way.
And even today, we still do that.
And I was going to mention, Shell, that here in America, and I know around the world,
a lot of people have rituals with baby teeth.
The truth fairy is pretty prevalent in American society.
And I mentioned the teeth in my book as well, because my mom used to keep oral teeth,
you know, that she used to put them in a wee box.
And I actually, for my book, I created a ritual to protect our children or family by using the teeth of our children.
And I did something similar with my children.
When they first started losing their teeth, I had little boxes that I created.
Admittedly, the first one was a pill box that I decorated, but that I made cute little boxes.
But I imbued them with energy to protect my children.
And as they would lose their teeth, I would hide them in those little boxes.
And I kept them with me through all these different moves.
And I would keep their teeth in these little and spelled boxes.
And when they each reached adulthood at age 18, I originally released those to give their energy.
You know, now they're adults, I'm no longer, I mean, I'm still their mother and still connected.
But to give that energy back to them by releasing those teeth, that was kind of my personal ritual with the teeth.
So you're no longer the keeper of their bones.
Yes, they're, oh, that's plus.
They need to look after their own bones.
Oh, you said that's a beautifully, yes, exactly, exactly.
And so even though we don't realize it, you know, that is a carryover from us honoring the bones of the people that we love,
even if we don't realize that's what we're doing.
Yeah.
And obviously, you know, we are literally, as we approach the end of September, we are literally, I mean, once we close the portal of the equinox,
we are literally in ancestral seasons.
Okay.
You know, this is not about waiting for the first show in, you know, or the 31st of October.
No, no, ancestral seasons begins with the autumn.
And there is one I, you know, when the wind comes back, blue wind cold, you know, after the summer,
and we see the leaves flying about.
And then is one I can, I can hear the song of the ancestors, you know, coming with the autumn, you know, playing with the leaves, you know, singing like a flute.
And around me, you know, the ancestors are already calling for their bones.
They're calling for their bones that coming, they're calling their children, their grandchildren to remember.
Remember me, I'm coming with the winter, you know, I'm coming with the autumn, you know, remember me, I'm coming.
And that's the song of the season, you know.
That's why I have a program I share with people online, you know, it's called, you know, your blood and bones.
And I start this program like the beginning of October because we need time to connect with ancestors
before we reach the portal of showing, you know, before we reach that date.
We have a job to connect with the ancestors and prepare their drawings and the altars, you know, and so, yeah.
That preparation period, yeah, we have a preparation period.
Yeah, it's about now.
Yeah, because if you think about it, we go through the gate of autumn in the north, obviously, we are in the north.
So we cross that gate and everything, you know, this song of bones, this ancestors start singing to us, you know.
So we need, we are connecting to death, okay?
So this is the season where we connect to the death, we connect to the past, we connect to the shadows of the season, you know.
Or our own shadows, you know, we already had a very long year before we entered this portal.
And the season, all these work prepare us to literally die in the last days of the year before we cross the next portal.
Before we go through the winter solstice portal, we literally have these few days before the solstice where we literally die.
It's all about death. It's about dying before we can receive the light and go back to life.
It's the Persephone time. This is when she goes within. This is the Anana going down. This is when it begins.
Like you said, it's not a, it's not a quick now is the time. Here's the doorway. It's a, it's a liminal space.
It's a, it's a gradual descending into the darkness. And it's honoring that descent.
And however we see that and it's, it's recognizing we need to get ready for that journey. It's, it's making those steps to connect with that energy, I think.
And finding that. And for me, I find myself a lot of times, I go out a lot more.
As the days are getting darker, I find myself clinging even more to the sunny days and being able to go out into my woods a little bit.
I think, you know, there's that rage rage against the dying of the light kind of moment happening.
And, and so I really look for that, but I also find that one of my practices is to decorate a lot this time of year.
You know, we bring the season in the pumpkins and the, the dying leaves and the, I happen to have a lot of bones.
Shell maybe not, but I have, I have deer skulls and antlers that I usually have year round.
But is there anything that you do to prepare for this time of year?
Well, like you, I try very much to be present with the citizen and to just try to connect and try to dance with energies of the season.
Because we are living in this crazy world where, or times that marked by what you need to do during the day, you know, what you need to work or you're looking after the children or whatever.
We hardly had time, you know, that time for connection. So I do make an effort to connect with the system and just tune in and just kind of open my heart and say, and ready to die again this year, you know.
And actually, last month, I have in my Patreon, the Invisible Sandals, I share with, with, with my students in, in Patreon, a ritual to literally kill themselves.
Hey witches, future Leila here, future Shell here. Wait, I'm usually not future Shell here. This is weird.
How funny.
We're just popping in to let you know she means figuratively.
Not literally. She means figuratively.
A lot of the themes and the mythology around this time of year involve figurative death, figuratively sacrificing ideas or habits or things in your life that no longer serve you.
Not literally. So just keep it in mind. She means figuratively.
Alright, so that's it for now, future Leila and future Shell out.
In the last days of the year, like, is there something you need, you want to kill? You want to let die before we close the portal?
So I actually shared a ritual and I said to them, I know a summer, but this is a very serious ritual. You need to get ready for this and you need to prepare through the system till you get to this moment.
And if you're ready to die, if you're ready to kill part of yourself, if you're ready to kill what no longer serves you, you need to prepare to do, you know, be prepared to do this.
So yeah, they're very much already getting ready for that.
You mentioned summer and I'm so glad you did because one of the things I wanted to touch on very quickly is the dark half of the year started at the summer solstice.
Yeah, that's when the dark half of the year starts and I know some people forget that, but that's when it really the days are really starting to get shorter than.
And now with the equinox is when we really notice it because now, oh crap, now it really is half and half in the dark.
We can really see the dark. I love that you have them start in the summer because that's when the dark work really begins.
I liked when you said that this is the time to kind of kill the things in yourself that no longer serve you because one thing I like to do this time of year is make lists of things that I need to be done with, put behind me, get over, move on.
You know, the whole point about these rituals like using those very last days of the year because for me the year ends right, you know, with the solstice right.
So those days before the solstice are the darkest ones of the year is literally about death and also winter is death.
Winter has been death in many cultures, many days are related to winter also related to death, you know, like Kyler and, you know, different goddesses or different days.
So the whole point was like, okay, so let's use this death, these days of death of pure darkness to do deep shadow work and use that powerful, you know, that powerful time right before the solstice to literally cleanse and kill whatever part of ourselves that no longer serve us or to kill
to kill, I mean, I'm talking like to kill, but we know it's an apothecical death, you know, but to kind of kill something whatever we need to kill in those days, so it doesn't cross the portal to the new year.
So for me was like, you know, everyone is, yeah, Christmas, you know, everyone, a lot of people celebrate Christmas, so the solstice is a happy holiday, but really we should be doing shadow work before the solstice, so that was a whole intention.
Yeah, that is the time of the kayak that is when she's walking the land and she's very scary death is scary, you know, I think even if it's a symbolic death like you're talking about, you know, setting those things down much like, you know, and Nana taking off each piece as she's descending, you set aside what, what doesn't serve you or you set aside offerings, but that's difficult, that's hard for people, you know, we're afraid of the kayak, we're afraid of the dark, we're afraid of death.
But remember what you don't shed, you'll end up carrying with you again to the next phase and sometimes that's the worst thing you can do for yourself.
Yeah, absolutely, that's why I thought, you know what, I need something hardcore, I'm going to go for this and I'm going to share it with my people in passion and I'm going to send it to the, you know, I actually said to the editor, do you want a winter ritual?
She would be happy, but she went like, yeah, send me a ritual and she got it.
Yeah, that might not be the sugar plums and pretty stars.
No, no.
Ritual she was thinking of, but it's definitely timely and seasonal, that's for sure.
Yeah, and at the end of the day, as a shamaness, you know, I'm a shadow hunter and that's what I help others to do, you know, to hunt for their own shadows.
As someone who is comfortable walking in that shadow realm, as someone who can walk the liminal like that, is there any advice or is there something that you could help prepare people so that they're not so afraid of that space?
Helping someone to maybe identify what they need to to kill off in their life or to let go of, they're afraid of letting go of that, is there any advice or is there anything that you would recommend to someone that they could do to face those shadows?
I mean, I can say to people, tap into yourself, you know how much this is affecting your life.
You know how much this is controlling your happiness, your day by day.
So if you're really tapping to yourself and you know how disturbing or sometimes destructive, it can be for you to carry that burden.
Then you're going to do for yourself, whatever you need to do, so you don't carry that burden anymore.
Sometimes you have to have that honest conversation with yourself.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
And sometimes it's easier for me to do things if I think I'm doing them for other people.
So I like how you said to have that conversation with yourself.
And yes, Shell, I'm going to mention journaling, but if you write it down, like write it down, like you're giving advice to someone else, like if your problem is say, you know procrastination or whatever, what advice would you give your best friend if they're struggling with procrastination, write that down, you know, and be that support for yourself.
And maybe sometimes if you can't find the strength to face those things for yourself, maybe if you pretend you're doing it for someone else, sometimes you can find that strength.
And in, you know, in this ritual, I mentioned, I actually also included something for because, you know, sometimes we carry the energy of other people, we carry the energy of others, other people at people's actions, you know, and things like that.
So as part of the ritual, I also try to tap into killing, whatever we carry from other people and get rid of the fear ourselves.
That's such a good point. You know, we do, we make those ties sometimes even when we shouldn't or even when it's hurting ourselves and being able to let that go is very important.
Yeah.
We talked about a little bit about ancestors and DAD and working with those energies. Do you have anything where you like to give back or to maybe make offerings to DAD or to land spirits in that way?
Are there any type of rituals or anything you do to recognize in that way?
I'm always making offerings to the spirits always is something something I do, especially to, you know, to the local spirits.
I normally, I normally keep my, my altar, but I'm packing boxes as we speak because I'm sending some stuff to Spain.
So I have this mantle, my, my altars, but I normally go to visit a local river and we go to, to see this river.
I go with my children and sometimes it's them that say, Mom, let's go and buy some milk for caramel.
You know, and we go and buy some milk for the river and we go, we make, you know, we do a prayer together and we offer caramel, milk and whatever we find in the shops like pancakes and, you know,
and so I'm always making offerings for the spirits always.
One of the questions we get sometimes from our listeners is if they make an offering, you know, if they're not maybe someplace where they can go to a river or outdoors to, to make offerings to the land spirits or to ancestors.
How can you make that big city?
Do you mean how do you make that offering a big city?
Yeah, if you don't have the link.
Okay, well, the big city is just a box, you know, the big city is just a bucket of the middle of somewhere, right?
And if you open that window, there is a steel wind blowing and there are stars in the sky, you know, that's not going away even if you live in a city.
If you don't, if you don't see them, they're still there.
We look at the same stars and the same moon that are ancestors or ancestors worship.
There are birds.
There are still we animals in the city, you know, they're parks.
They are trees.
You might not be in the middle of the forest, but the sacred is, you know, all over the place, even if we are in a city.
I'm going to pick up my wee boy from school and we cross a very VC road.
And just at the other side, it's this huge tree.
And it's very, you know, it's just grass, this big tree, next to the road.
But when we cross the road, immediately, we go under the tree and we say hello.
You know, it's like, hello, you know, we can see you and we're here.
My boy and my girl asked where when she was we.
It was, you know, she found moss, moss somewhere in a wall.
She will stop and say hello, moss, you know, and just touch the moss.
And my wee one does the same.
You know, my wee boy just touches the moss and say, oh, my mom, there is moss.
Can I say hello?
Yeah, yeah, just go and say hello to the moss.
And he just goes, touches the moss and says hello.
You see, there is life and sacred all around us.
That's the matter where you are.
You can still connect to the sacred.
You can do this.
You mentioned that your children are so connected to the natural world.
I heard an interview with you in the past where you mentioned being very connected to the water and to the sea.
And part of that has to do with your father and your childhood.
Yes.
Shell is also very much a water priestess.
Do you mind telling us a little bit about your connection to animism and to the sea?
Yeah.
Well, you know, my dad was a scuba diver in the army.
So I was a scuba diver before I was properly running.
And yeah, so I learned scuba diving with my dad.
He was always surfing or we were always sailing.
I spent my days by the beach eating whatever I could find on the beach.
I had my knife and I could just go and get stuff and feed myself.
So make a fire and cook some food or eat some star raw that I knew I could eat, you know.
So yeah, I always had this special relationship with the sea.
But then my mom is from the mountains.
And in the mountains, I enjoyed this roaming in these wild spaces.
You know, proper wild forest with waterfalls and beautiful rivers, you know, and ponds.
And so I was kind of in between the mountains and the sea.
But there was always water.
There was always water for me.
It sounds like your childhood was very deeply connected to the earth and to natural spaces.
Yeah, yeah.
Obviously, I didn't know I was a nearer divergent person.
And when I was little, my mom just said I was too much, you know, she used to say I was too much.
I had too much energy.
But I guess me being a nearer divergent person.
And also a dreamwalker, being a dreamwalker.
Because I always been a dreamwalker, walking in between space, you know, dimensions and places.
Since I was little, I guess these sensory issues that I have when I go out to the world and everything is too noisy, everything is too much, you know.
When I go to nature that was for me was like it opened that huge connection, you know, to nature in a very special way.
And my whole childhood was like very animistic, you know, everything.
I was literally connected to everything around me plus being a dreamwalker and being connected to the spirits and spirits coming to me.
Because they, the new, you know, I could listen to them, I could, you know, and things like that.
So I think it was all set up for me from the beginning.
Does that make this time of year difficult for you?
Being a dreamwalker and being in connection with the spirit world like that?
Sometimes he's heavy.
Yes. Sometimes he's heavy.
Now for folks who have kind of that similar type of connection, do you have any recommendations to kind of turn it down a while,
shut it off for a little while so you're getting that kind of mental and spiritual break from being bombarded by spirit?
Yeah. You got your contracts, right?
So write down the best closest you can for yourself.
If you know what's coming, set up your closest and say, okay, so this is my line.
I'm not crossing this line.
I don't want anything to cross this line.
Because I'm, you know, I have my space.
I got my responsibilities and I need to focus on what I need to do.
So set up your contract properly with the spirits.
I like that. I like calling it a contract.
Yeah, absolutely.
And make sure when you are in service is very important that you are in service from consciousness.
Okay, you are in service. You're not a slave.
So it's very different. You're not a slave to the spirits.
You know, I am as a priestess. I serve the gods and the spirits.
But I got my own mortal life.
And I need to be present here as well.
Boundaries are important in spirit world just like they are in the material world.
Yeah, with working with with the spirits and with ancestors to kind of bring it back to bones just just for a moment.
I'd like to talk just a little bit about working with bones in practice.
Because I know, you know, Shell gets a little ick doubt by it.
I do have some bones in my charm casting set.
I have some bones on my altar and on my ancestor altar.
And I know the reasons why I use them, which is mainly because I think that they contain so much of the universe.
They connect us to so many things to each other, to the past, to the earth, to the carbon that makes up the universe, I guess.
And so I feel that that very much just by seeing the bones of a creature or having that they are honoring the life of that being and honoring the connection to the all is a lot how I see it and why I find them powerful in my workings.
Could you talk to us a little bit about working with bones and how you work with them or honor them in your practice?
You know, I think for me, it's exactly the same that it is for you.
I find them a way to connect to everything that is and when you study the biology of the bones, how they form the minerals, everything, you understand.
You know, we are from the earth, we belong to the earth, you know.
And we are all connected by the bones because they contain the same material, you know.
When you really go into the biology of it and how they form and they function in everything is easy to understand how we connect to the world around us, you know.
To the world that we walk in and obviously, as you said, they connect me to those spirits.
And for me, that's important, especially as a shamanist, you know, as a spirit worker, I want to connect with the spirits.
So if I'm doing a ritual and I want to bring to my ritual dear energy or badger energy for whatever reason, you know, if I want to protect someone and I want to work with a badger because they're great protectors.
I actually have a badger tooth just there in the wee box, you know.
So, you know, I include that tooth as part of my ritual because I want to bring the energy of the badger to my work, you know.
So for me, well, I mentioned earlier that containers, you know, they're key to the energies, you know, to those energies.
So I want to be able to do that. Obviously, I honor those energies, I honor the spirit of those animals, I make offerings, you know.
But basically for me, they actually are a very important part of my work.
I agree. I just think that they are, it's the magical framework that kind of powers this meat skeleton around.
And I just, there's so much mystery to that for me. I know that we understand them scientifically, but there's something mystical about them.
I just, they last forever. I mean, we have bones from dinosaurs and mammoths and people that lived thousands of years ago, we know about them because of their bones.
Yeah, but you see, they are, they really are that containers, you know, they really are, they really contain the memories of who we are, as species, as human beings.
Their storytellers, bones are storytellers. They have so many stories to tell and every time someone digs out a bone, there is a story being told, but that very bone.
So that's why my book is so many stories, but it's not spooky, you know, it is not as pookies. I think it's a lovely book.
It is a very lovely book and I do highly recommend it. Again, the book is sacred bones, magic bones, stories from the path of the bones.
And it is full of stories. There's folklore in here. There's all sorts of information. There's things you can do.
So I do highly recommend it. Now you have another book coming out in December, also looking forward to it.
Yes, tell us about that a little. Yeah, of course. So there is this anthology that is coming out in December, divine wounds.
And basically, this anthology contains a story of healing, of feminine healing linked to the divine.
For many, many women approach, approach the goddess from a wound because they need healing and they approach the goddess from that wound.
But what a lot people, a lot of people overlooked is that there are goddesses that they are really wounded, like really wounded as well.
And it's funny because sometimes women seek, they vibrate with the same wound. They connect to the deities that carry the same wound, you know.
And sometimes we underestimate the power of working with a goddess that is wounded as a woman that is wounded.
And we connect the divine and human. We connect, you know, mortal and immortal. We connect through the winds.
And sometimes they are amazing stories that connect us, you know.
So yeah, the book I invited a beautiful bunch of ladies to share a story, to share a healing story connecting to a deity.
And we put them together in this anthology because I think there is, there is too much glitter, you know, when we talk goddess, you know.
You know, people tend to think like, oh yeah, new pagans, they're just about crowds and glitter and fighting unicorns.
And it's like, no, you know, there, a lot of people carry very deep wounds.
It's a deeper darker side.
Yeah, yeah. And there is a reason that it was this emerge of the dark goddess some years ago, because, you know, there is this shadow, this very deep shadow and the pain and the wounds that we carried, you know, in the community as well.
Most of the people I know in the pagan community, they have their own wounds as well, you know.
And we just get together and we connect to the gods and we are together.
So this book is kind of a breach between mortals and immortals, you know, to kind of say, hey, you worship this goddess.
Maybe the goddess has wounds, you know, you have not recognized, you have not mirror these wounds.
Look at the goddess again, you know, you might be actually be working with this goddess because there are wounds that do share with this goddess.
And we do that unconsciously sometimes, but other times we are fully conscious that we are approaching this goddess because we are wounded and we share the same wound.
First, I am going to give you an example. She is not a goddess, but she is kind of becoming a goddess because of the amount of devotion and energy she is receiving.
And I am talking about Medusa, okay.
She is a good one for now.
Yeah. And I actually mentioned her in another book that is coming. I have another book coming.
It's called Sacred Tatooine, you know, about ritual tattoo, you know.
And in that book, I mentioned how some people that have suffer sexual abuse, they actually tattoo themselves a Medusa as a way of connecting with her because she was also sexual abuse, you know.
And I think Medusa is a great example on how people connect to the myth and her story and her wound, especially if they can mirror their own wound, you know, with hair, you know.
They just start in front of Medusa and they can recognize that they can see their abuse and they can mirror their feelings, you know, with the spirit, you know.
And so I think she is a great example.
And actually, one of the authors, CNCBly, she wrote about Medusa for divine wounds.
And myself, I wrote about a Welsh goddess, Arianderoth, and the narcissistic wound, you know, the narcissistic abuse.
And I put on the table how she was actually, you know, she suffered narcissistic abuse.
Arianderoth, you know, in the myths and everything. So I put that on the table. I put the shadow of the myth, use of the myths.
You know, I put that shadow on the table for people to be able to mirror that wound.
It's very powerful because I think if we can recognize that these all powerful deities, these goddesses that we revere and that we honor, if they have wounds that are similar to ours, and yet they are still goddess, they are still powerful, then we can be too.
Yeah, absolutely. That's the whole point about the book.
There is also another author, Lindsay River.
And I actually, I asked her to bring this story to the book because she shares the story about how in Anna was actually raped.
And how she searches for the rapist, like, you know, and it's a really hard, harsh story. And she is powerful in Anna.
And actually, there is a, because I also, this year, I was speaking in the goddess conference in customary.
And I was running a workshop because I have been working with in Anna also for, you know, for some time, I will say.
It was one of the things that always pieces me off, that a lot of people knows the story of the scent of in Anna, but they have, they have not kind of explore why that she goes, how does this goddess ends up going to the underworld.
And the thing about what it strikes me from the myths is that actually when she gets raped, okay, when, you know, when she's suffered these sexual abuse and maybe you should put a content warning.
I will, I will.
She's just back from heavens, from taking the powers from her dad, okay, so she's back from heaven, she has the symbols of the powers from heaven.
So she is very powerful at that point already. And then she lies under this streak, or she's exhausted from the working heaven trying to get the powers, you know, she's tired.
She, she goes into deep sleep onto this tree and this guy, this gardener sees her sees the goddess sleeping in it, you know, in a deep sleep and abuse her when she's already like super powerful, okay.
So yeah, goddesses also suffered, they carry deep wounds and yet they are goddesses, the resilience and power and will to continue and become more strong even, you know, after, you know, it's, it's a beautiful mirror for a lot of women that have suffered abuse.
Like for me, you know, survivor of narcissistic abuse, it was actually a real rose that picked me up and kind of said, I know exactly what you're going through.
And then is when I actually surrender to the story and when deeper and she just put it on the table for me and I was like, wow, she was my mirror at that point.
And, and she helped me and actually this, this anthology of divine wounds, it's happened because, because of her.
It's beautiful.
It was my gift to her. It was like, no, I try, I actually try to submit my first article, you know, my first to say about abuse and a real rose to another anthology and say, no, because it's a bit too dark.
Everything else is a bit nicer.
And I felt so, you know, so upset, I was thinking, so you're not taking this piece because the rest of the essays are like glitter.
But we need, we need to read this as well, you know, we need the shadow to, we need the shadow, we need to look at the mirror of this wound.
I was like, no, I'm going to honor that part of the story. I'm going to honor Arianne Road by putting an anthology myself together for her.
So that's December. And as I said, there are other amazing authors that really open the wounds, you know, and put them on the table and how, you know, they've been working with different goddesses to connect with, you know, with and find healing.
You know, that's the whole point. And this is a good time of year definitely to do that. Well, thank you for sharing that. I'm definitely going to be looking for that. You said that's coming from moon books.
Yeah, moon books, like the beginning of December is going to be out.
We'll put links to all of that. So thank you so much, Ness, for joining us for and for sharing all of your wisdom and all of this information.
You've given me so much to think about and so much to look forward to. I very much appreciate your time here. Thank you so much.
Absolutely, Ness. Thank you so much.
Thank you. And if you would now you mentioned that you're going to be traveling, you're going to be teaching coming up here in the future. Is there anything that people might be looking forward to or that they might be able to sign up for?
I'm going to be traveling to Iceland in just a couple of weeks. I'm going to be in the Netherlands and I'm going to be in the island as well.
Hopefully at some point I might be back with you in the States.
I have my patrons, you know, I have the invisible sandals where I share the sea priestess, sea priesthood training.
I share the priestess of Alba for people that is connected to Scotland so they can work with the Scottish goddesses, you know.
And Dates, I also have my shamanic patron, the clan of the bone woman, Clan de la Westera. So I always do things online as well. Awesome.
Well, we'll put links to all of that for you. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. Thank you for being here. So we really appreciate it. Thank you for spending the time with us. Thank you so much.

Welcome to Back on the Brumstick, a modern witch's spoken word grimoire, where two witchy
friends from way back are reconnecting to their pagan roots after a long period of
mundanity, where rewalking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells,
rituals and magical theory in today's witchcraft and pagan practices.
So grab your wand and your incense, your cauldron and your crystals, and join us as we get
Back on the Brumstick.
Hi and welcome to a special meditation edition of Back on the Brumstick.
This is a companion episode to number 129, Water Energy, Emotion, Intuition and the Sacred
Self.
I'm Layla and this meditation to borrow a pond from Shell, dives into the magical, emotional
and intuitive energies of elemental water.
And I'm going to be honest with you guys.
This meditation was extremely difficult for me to write and record.
I think this is revision number 7 or somewhere around there.
Things are a little crazy right now.
The world is in a lot of upheaval.
Emotions are running high, the ground seems to be shifting underneath our very feet, and
tomorrow is not certain.
I'm feeling a lot of emotions myself, a lot of anger, fear, concern, a lot of frustration
and helplessness.
And every time I tried to dive into my subconscious and into those emotions, I would get either
extremely upset, extremely angry or extremely weepy.
It was difficult.
I had to work through a lot of those watery, deep emotions myself, I think, before I could
really face this meditation.
So I apologize for how late it is, but I'm pretty happy with it, where it is at this
point.
So.
That being said, in which craft water is the realm of emotion, intuition, dreams and
the deep subconscious, it's very often associated with the west, the direction of dusk, twilight
and the in between.
Water is the cauldron of carrot width.
It is the sacred well of the subconscious from which we draw our magic.
Working with water energy and meditation allows us to connect with our magical mind, the
subconscious or what some might call the dream self.
This is where imagery, emotion and intuition live.
We're going to journey inward to that sacred well of water to access deep inner knowing,
that ancient wisdom, that transcends logic, the place where the old gods of the sacred
waters and where your magic lives.
Water can help you move through blockages and that's pretty much what I've been doing
these last couple of weeks trying to work with this element and get a meditation out to
you guys.
I had a lot of blockages, I had a lot of motion.
So working with this on a pretty regular consistent basis has helped me to connect and kind of
calm those tides to calm those raging waves and unlock the inner peace and healing that
I was trying to talk about before.
Our bodies are made up of mostly water.
Just like the tides, we respond to the moon, we respond to the energies around us.
Our blood, our tears, the tides and rhythms of our life echo the rivers and oceans of
the world.
The same water that is in our body has moved through clouds through the roots of the tallest
trees through ancient streams before finally finding its way into ourselves.
We are made of the moon-charged magic from the waters of every which whoever set a jar
out under the full moon.
We are not separate from the element.
We are the water and the chalice.
Working with elemental water helps you to become soft without breaking, to feel these emotions,
especially when emotions are running hot and high, to feel those emotions without drowning
in them, to feel those unseen currents of magic and energy in life, and to know when to
grab them, and to know when to surrender when to the cycles of ebb and flow.
Which is known that still water reflects truth, and rough water has the power to reshape
a landscape.
So, for this meditation, we are going to travel within to that sacred well, the sacred waters
within ourselves, and meet the old gods that are there, recognize them, see what gifts
of strength and justice and wisdom that they have for us, and then bring those energies
back with us to the waking world.
So, set your space, find some place where you won't be disturbed, maybe where you can
hear a fountain, or maybe you have a bath in the next room, or if you're lucky, you can
hear the sound of rain on your window.
If you'd like to, you can play a video of rain sounds.
I promise I won't tell anyone, and your subconscious won't know the difference.
You could play a little light music that reminds you of water.
Make things soft and comfortable, maybe blue fabric or blue pillows, a white silver or
blue candle.
Maybe an incense that reminds you of clear, beautiful days or the smell of a spring rain.
Have a little bit of water and some food for after the ritual to reconnect with your physical
cell.
Once you're ready, settle into your spot, and if you feel comfortable and good doing so,
go ahead and close your eyes.
Alright, let's begin.
We'll take in a nice, deep, cleansing, grounding breath, and then let it go with a sound.
Let your breath come naturally, as breathe like normal, no need to change anything yet.
Simply be here in this moment, with your breath flowing in and out, normal and comfortable
relaxing into your space.
Your breath is like water, always moving, always shifting, always there.
As you breathe, begin to imagine your mind as a still, clear lake.
Thoughts may ripple across the surface, but they do not disturb the depths.
Let them come, let them float away.
There is nothing to chase, nothing to fix, only your breath and stillness.
Relax and as you breathe, inhale softly through your nose, pause for a moment, and exhale
slowly through your mouth, like water slipping back into the sea.
Let yourself be rocked by the rhythm, inhale, feel your belly expand like the gentle rise
of a wave, exhale, release.
Your breath is like a gentle rolling tide.
Now, bring your attention to the feeling of your breath, cool or warm, smooth or ragged.
Just notice how you're breathing, the sound, the feel.
Your body knows how to breathe, just as water knows how to flow, allow your awareness
to settle here in this moment.
Take another slow breath in through your nose, filling your belly first, then your ribs,
and then your chest, exhaling slowly through your mouth, releasing tension.
Again, inhale deeply, expanding your body, exhale fully.
With each cycle, feel your body growing heavier, more relaxed, as if being cradled by water
itself.
And on your next inhalation, bring your focus to your third eye, the space between your
eyebrows, let your inner gaze rest there, soft and steady, and with each breath, imagine
a gentle stream of cool energy, cool water flowing through that point of your forehead,
washing away any stray thoughts, opening your inner vision.
Allow yourself to drift on that flow, here in a receptive state, and allow your subconscious
to stir.
With each inhalation through your third eye, relax more deeply into this moment.
And now, imagine or envision that before you is a path of colored stones stretching
along a beach, you're breathing like the waves, the tide, the sound of the water, next
to you, as you walk along the stones in the sand.
Imagine the stones in front of you are red, the color of strength and the sunset, the
bold color behind your eyes.
As you walk this path of red stones, with each breath draw in that red light through
your third eye, filling yourself with vitality and energy and passion.
Continue to walk along the path as the color shifts from red to orange, radiating warmth
and creativity.
Inhale and allow that orange light to bathe over you, the colors of fall and comfort and
home.
Walk further down the beach as the stones begin to glow yellow with clarity and focus,
sunlight and beginnings.
Feel the color yellow flow through your third eye, bringing your mental focus, clarity and
peace.
Inhale and walk again along the cool stones, exhale fully, hearing the water in the distance
against the shore.
As you get closer to the water, the stones are now green with moss, soft healing.
Breathe in deeply and feel that green energy flow through you and exhale slowly through
that center spot of your third eye, down along your body, feel the balance, the harmony,
the renewal flow through you, with each breath of that green energy.
And you walk down and down and down along the moss colored path.
Now the blue stones appear cool and serene, the air is wet and damp.
And as you breathe in the blue air, you can tell your closer to the source of water.
On your next inhale, allow that energy to flow over you, serene, still, clear and cool
like the waters of a deep well, like the waters of deep knowing.
And now as you move down and down to the sacred well, the light is dark and purple, the
air is mystical, inviting insight, wisdom, transformation.
And as you breathe that purple light settles around your head like a crown, glowing,
strong, divine with wisdom.
You have walked along the bridge from your conscious mind to your magical mind.
Here you are in the depths of subconscious knowing your mystical brain, the place where
your magic lives.
Here you are sovereign, here you wear the crown of power.
And before you here is a well, ancient stones, sacred waters, deep and dark and full of
knowing, full of the past, the future, and all things in between, the stars of the universe
sparkle on its surface, gaze at yourself in the water.
You are deity, you are sovereign, here your crown glistens with every color of the rainbow,
refracted in the depths and in the drops of water all around you.
As you gaze into the sacred well, the well of your subconscious, the place of your mystery
and your power, feel the presence of the old gods in the deep, stirring just below the
surface, waking to your call.
These are protectors, guides, ancient beings.
You are connected to the protectors of the deep.
Their presence is an armor and a blessing, a shield and a sword.
Breathe in deep.
Exhale fully.
Place your hands palm up on your thighs, on the arms of the chair, on the floor, supported,
secure.
And as you breathe, pay attention to the centers of your palms.
This is where your power will rise.
Now, focus your inner vision again on your third eye, the seat of psychic vision and intuitive
wisdom, the space that connects that deep well of your magical self to the tides of universal
energy.
And as you focus your inner gaze on your third eye, raise the power in your palms by whispering
and repeating the mantra, intuition, awaken, creation, flow, intuition, awaken, creation,
flow.
Quickly, rhythmically at first, gradually growing in volume and power as you go, feel the warmth
in your palms, feel the power in your third eye, intuition, awaken, creation, flow.
Remember to breathe and let the mantra fall from your lips like a river rushing, intuition,
awaken, creation, flow, faster and louder with each repetition, intuition, awaken, creation,
flow, continue to chant and allow the power in your palms to grow and build with your voice,
intuition, awaken, creation, flow.
We are created in water.
Your body is mostly water, and through this you are deeply connected to the mother of all,
the creator of all, to the moon, into the deep well of psychic ability, magic and knowing,
intuition, awaken, creation, flow, faster and louder, words like a river flowing to
the ocean, racing to the waterfall, gathering in power and size and strength, intuition,
awaken, creation, flow.
Water can be a gentle spring rain and is also the unstoppable force of a rip tide, a
tidal wave, a tsunami.
You are the water, you are the rain, the storm, the tides.
As you chant, feel the energy and gather it powerfully one last time.
Intuition, awaken, creation, flow, take a deep breath and place one hand on your heart
and raise the other palm out to the universe.
And as you exhale fully, let the energy you have raised flow from your hand to your heart
through your whole body and project it from your palm to the universe, a cycle like the
rain to the earth, back to the clouds in the sky, a never-ending connection between you,
your sacred well of magic and the waters of life.
The energy you gathered and raised so steep into your body, your bones in your blood,
healing, cleansing and powering and protecting, drink your fill of this energy and direct
the rest out to the universe, to your purpose.
Then let it abbe in balance within you and bring your hands to your center, resting
them on your belly or your thighs.
Take in a deep cleansing breath, expanding your belly and your chest fully, pause and hold
your breath for a moment before exhale and releasing it fully with sound.
And after me, I am intuitive, I am sacred, I am, elemental water has always been part
of you in your bones, your blood, your mind and your magic.
The connection to the sacred well strengthens each time you call, breathe in deeply and
now begin to bring your awareness again to your breath, a soft familiar rhythm, my
quaves touching the shore, the gentle in, the gentle out, a tide flirting with the moon.
The energy of elemental water and the old gods remains within you, in your dreams, in
your power and in your voice.
And now take another deep breath and exhale slowly through your mouth and begin to return
to the surface of your awareness as if slowly rising through the waters of the sacred
well, up through the purple and the blue and the green, up through the quiet, the sunlight
in the water above shining yellow as you rise through orange and red, the light behind
your closed eyes, up through the shimmering space between dream and waking, rising further.
The last drops of sacred water drips from your fingertips and you are standing again on
the shore, refreshed, clear and empowered.
Fail your body again, the surface beneath you, supported, safe, the flow of life all around
you.
Gently wiggle your fingers, your toes, roll your head, move your shoulders and stretch.
Take in a deep breath and exhale slowly, fully and open your eyes.
Take a moment to connect to the here and now, before standing up.
Have a drink of water, a little bit of food, maybe take a bath or a shower to connect
to your physical soul.
Go a little bit slowly until you come fully back from that alpha state.
I hope this meditation helps you feel refreshed, renewed and ready to take on challenges
with that ancient power within.
Water is not just for cleansing, water is powerful and powerful.
And sometimes, we need a little touch of the old gods of the well to get through what
life is throwing at us.
Thank you so much for joining us for this water meditation.
Join us again for our next episode.
Until then, stay safe, your magical people and keep it witchy.

----------------------------------------
welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  I am welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and this is the fifth of our five-part Elemental Series in this episode will be talking about Spirit Akasha ether the element that connects all the other elements and I'm show and you know I'm almost said that this this little mini series is coming to an end but ending with spirit and ding with that the Kasha energy it's exciting but I'm sad wrap up the series it is wonderful to reminisce about old thoughts old Deeds I'm how we viewed things how maybe those views have changed are still ons in my opinion but the opportunity to seek out some new content and material in the form of books and information and kind of get different thoughts and perspectives about elements that  thought of in the past and I do really just want a quick mention this book because it was really Kick-Ass obviously going back through I don't know what I have 56 old books of Shadows you know Reminiscing on that but I got a hand on Karen Michelle's love the name by the way here and Michelle's Elemental witchcraft a guide To Living a magical life through the elements fabulous book this is not a sponsored book actually paid for this and it was Kick-Ass and helped me with this deep dive into the elements I see all the notes we want to go get it so I am also getting a copy of that book to check out again not a sponsor but I'm so glad that you mentioned books and going down memory lane because I actually have a listener question that I'd like to bring up before we go any further with this episode now this is a question that I get a lot of questions  before but again we get a spit a lot so I'm going to answer it yet again back in some of our earlier episodes we mentioned one book repeatedly and we said this book was called 10000 goddesses and we talked about it quite often that we always would refer to this book when looking up goddesses around the world this is a perfect example of a Mandela effect it is because you and I are both absolutely 100% sure it was called Ten Thousand see the cover of it in my head and very clearly it says 10,000 goddesses that book does not exist dammit Mandela effect at all in the alternate universe where Michelle and I both had this book that's where it exists but it's an amalgamation of two books that we both had it that time do which is goddess by Janet and Stewart Farrar and also  book of goddesses and heroines by Patricia Monaghan so those two books which neither one of them has $10,000 in it but those two books other ones that we kind of somehow put together in our heads to create 10,000 goddesses know you're wrong there wasn't called that I just did it's been wiped from like the internet and like it's just been wiped I don't know why you do my logical brain knows that that book does not exist I know this however my memory and my subconscious beg to differ they are insistent that the book is real and I just haven't found it yet and sometimes you and I have both lost our copies of it mine must have been lost in the flood that you must have lost your son to move it I don't know but in my mind when I think of the two books 10,000 goddesses in ten thousand Gods I am thinking of the covers of the witches God in the sky  okay if it's interesting because 10,000 goddesses to me has the car goddesses and heroines really yeah same title different cover so I guess it really is just an amalgamation of all of thousands and thousands of goddesses and gods that information on them lots of good information in those books and goddesses it's just us and our terrible memories no speaking of books that are fabulous and fabulous witchy book stores that you can get them at I'm probably going to get that Elemental book when I come visit you in Salem at the shop where you got it now speaking of visiting me in Salem and coming in contact with me at the shop I work at I saw  first murder in the bayou very cool I was so excited when you mentioned that you were just so thrilled that a listener had found you I literally texted you while I was still there so I don't know who is more excited you or them probably both of us but we do have a public service announcement we do I want to thank everybody who does go to Salem and have a good time there's so much to see and do their shell and I will definitely help you with our favorites with what we like show the local so she's certainly has the inside track size as her bestie I do want to put out there with your friend PSA when you go to Salem Massachusetts and you happen to find our favorite podcasting goddess the queen of the Wichi Airwaves shell working her fun part time job hugs are wonderful she will happily take a selfie with you but remember she is working and although her  faucet

a listener and this was so funny cuz you know they were walking around the store you know you can greet people hi how you doing what can I help you so I kind of look at this guy I don't know why you know sometimes you're just drawn to people and he was looking at me and he was looking at me and you know I keep walking well I started talking to one of my co-workers I don't even know what I was saying blah blah blah blah blah and then it comes up to me and he goes I do have a question do you do a podcast cuz I have a distinctive voice shall I do you know I have allergies so that doesn't help either and he's a big fan you was visiting from  Orleans we did hugs we did a selfie it was fabulous actually he tagged Us in the selfie check it out online and it was such a wonderful interaction and I'm so glad you stopped in and said something you commented to me like immediately if I would like to buy it if I don't  I don't know who was more excited hit where I see it now that's a lovely and pretty sure you're going to get more and more of those and when it's quiet that's not a problem at all how fun is that a lovely attraction and it's time to store wasn't busy at all I was just so you

Shelby to see more fans in the wild  have work unfortunately but definitely say something definitely say hi I am all for hugs I would love to meet you and have a really brief conversation but like I said if it's super busy I don't want you to be upset if I have to continue working is this where is shell like find Shell in the wild in Salem if you find Shell in what in the wild in Salem tag her on our Facebook group or Instagram or Instagram and tell us where you're from and what day you found her but don't say we're we're we're trying to just keep we're under wraps right now because I don't want to piss my boss off yeah he's a good guy we love him to be like you know what you're here to do a job not meet listeners so we're trying to keep under wraps where I am but if you go to all of the best witchy shops in Salem if I am working that day you'll find me  glad that you have a nice fun outwardly facing job and as long as you're able to keep it things will be great help me keep my sight until this podcast starts doing anything other than costing us money I need to work that's right we need to have regular jobs or two and please don't park downtown Salem you are coming to Salem and you are like I'm just going to park on the street no go to the MBTA train station parking ramp that's your best bet that's all I got for you love you see you soon yeah so parking is going to be absolute hell take some public transportation in to Salem save yourself and everyone else a headache wrinkled I'm all right so now we've gotten all that out of the way let's get into this really interesting topic of spirit know I had a thought and I think that sometimes  people might get a little bit confused with the element of spirit vs. deity okay yeah you know I have the same thought I figured I'd bring it up now because will spearhead off this the element of spirit making sure that we're making that clear line between spirit and deity with deity I look at it me personally almost kind of like different different faces of the same entity spirit I feel is more encompassing of that and everything yeah I agree I think spirit is everything spirit is the element that weaves all the other elements together it's the energy of life and Magic itself everything and everywhere but it has no shape or name of its own deity on the other hand is different videos much more personal gods and goddesses are Divine forces with names and stories and will  they embody big aspects of the world and life around us that we have trouble explaining any other way like love wisdom the moon or fertility but we give it an identity that you can call on that you can worship and build a relationship with so it's more personal that way so in my opinion you feel spirit in meditation and the magic in the world and in powerful things and moment and you talked to Daddy both our sacred Spirits the all the everything and deity is the space that we give two parts of spirit so that we can better understand it and so that we can better work with it and a lot of times people particularly if you have a Wiccan background or if you get into that kind of Elemental background people will call you in the spirit position we talked about North being Earth people will say Spirit the center position is d a d but they're not the same thing Spirit has different names in different cultures but they all describe  something that's extraordinary something precious and sacred the Greeks came up with ether because if the air that's high enough and special enough for the gods to breathe or sometimes people call it quintessence which literally means fifth element or a Kasha which is space because it was special it was this element that kind of wraps around everything that encompassed everything so if it's more than just I hate to say just eating so don't mean it like that but it but it's everything what I think of you know how when you was thinking your mind you know we've talked about visualizing each of these elements and you know what are you might visualize Cool Breeze or fire roaring fire you know water of a river and Ocean Creek a stream  with Spirit what I envisioned in my mind when I'm visualizing spirit is space space space like outer space the spiral nebula visualizing deity I have a face you know what I'm saying you know it's interesting because I like the idea of universe as everything to me when I talk about Universe are Universal energy I'm talking about exactly that Spirit the all the everything and it isn't a deity it but it is everything but it's all encompassing exactly they have a name they have a back story they have history behind them they are a face of spirits they are an aspect of spirit but they are not all of spirit so now let's talk about this.  now that we've talked about his spirit is not I think of it as this all-encompassing energy that kind of what I'm visualizing is it taking that earth air fire water my energy is swirly snow globe of wonderfulness spirit is kind of the all-knowing in my mind kind of the I don't want to say the end-all-be-all but kinda Kate of Kate and Frank Fame back in the day some of my first teachers okay okay we've all seen the pentacle right as a description of the elements and people will ascribe air fire water Earth to the different points of the pentacle and some people will say that the top point is Spirit correct I was taught that the top point is  spell and that spirit is the lines that make up the pentacle oh oh shit I like that I've never heard that actually isn't that beautiful because spirit is what makes it all spiritual connection all together I like that I love that it is between everything and it creates everything if you didn't have Spirit you wouldn't have that Pentacles I have the elements on it so you know as much as I love that in my mind I think maybe instead of self instead of self that could be where I would Place deity would be sure absolutely but I also think that deity is so I think that we are deity and so that fits for me that I could interchange those in my mind and in my belief system all life is Daddy your daddy I'm daddy Namaste the Divine Light Within Me recognizes the Divine Light Within you kind of thing will remember that photo where they equate the human body  do you know where the guy who spread out the point is his head like your knowledge your enter your enter your enter Divine so that's kind of what I was taught is that that's that's what spirit is you know it's a little hard to describe sometimes because it's that ineffable something that gives us life sometimes I described it as chaos and all right for all of your Puris out there I am not talking about the Austin Osman spare version of chaos magic I'm talking about chaos itself the chaos of nature the chaos of Life the chaos that somehow made some little organism crawl out of the ocean and become shell and I talking to you on these microphone that chaos that spark of wild random chance that chaos to me is spirit and so that's hard to describe as hard to pin down and that's why I was a little I was a little ants  see about this particular episode cuz I'm like how the hell do you describe Spirit 2 from the symbology touchdown as a little bit with it with a pentacle but there are a lot of symbols that people throughout time have used to depict Spirit and the sky in the universe have been and done some of those depictions and I think that is maybe where I get that thought of when I realized Spirit energy I'm kind of visualizing the stars out in space you know that idea of space to me something beyond what we can touch that magical fire that's out there a sort of Saint candles for example and you know how you have your symbol for fire you have your symbol for water so what I would I use for a symbol of spirit is actually the star I'm not  saying a pentacle purse say and sometimes used to represent spirit I color it in so it is distinctively not a pentacle because of that visualization of space being what works for me and so that that star is that Spirit energy and again I am distinguishing a star separate for optical eye like that and it's interesting because one of the symbols that I see a lot representing spirit is a circle but not the line of the circle the center of a circle the nothingness that's right there like an actual Circle itself sometimes will represent spirit and I think that's interesting because when we would call Spirit if we're doing say what we would think of as a traditional Circle we would call Deedee as a representative of spirit to fill the center of the circle right and I do see sometimes when you're talking about putting things on an altar  sometimes people will just leave the center of the altar empty to represent spirit because that's a place for Spirit to fill so you'll see is that sometimes it is an empty vessel or even just an empty space to represent space for that Spirit to come in to see now as far as altar set up I kind of look at the altar itself is Spirit holding up all the other elements so I look at the actual altar as the spirit tool holding up an encompassing all of the other tools and elements I love that idea could do that intentionally on the altar itself and as a representation of spirit put oils on it or rub in senses into it put it out under the moon or the sun to absorb energy to be that Spirit representation  Rochester my neighbors probably said shit like that on a regular basis crap out in the one of the other representations that I really love for spirit is the spiral absolutely absolutely viral just like Spirit represents Evolution it represents growth of the spirit it's a symbol of change and movement we've done something with spirals before I feel like we've done something not too long ago with spirals we did this Fool's Journey back in March at the Sacred Space conference down in Maryland so let's let's talk about how our Fool's Journey ritual kind of relates to this Spirit energy is that liminal space we talked about it being the lines itself of the pentacle and spirals are one of the oldest symbols of spirit energy spirit is the on  thread that connects and animates everything all of existence and spirals represent that energy either the path of Awakening the Journey of the soul may begin at the center with the self and a spiral outward to the universe or back inward towards your own self towards your personal Divine truth spirals represent that Spirit energy that flows through all things and that's kind of what we talked about when we did that ritual the full star knee was finding that spark within yourself wherever you happen to be on that spiral if you keep walking that you're going to come back to yourself at some point you know you're going to find that to you you within yourself that spiral represents the sacred is the first step of a journey you know it's the Fool's journey of that sacred self that sacred hero's journey that we all kind of go off and it's that liminal space where everything is possible that's what Spirit represents your spirit is that spark it's that pretend before the spa  exactly is everything and nothing could you do when I talked about my visualization of space in the universe the Stars you mentioned that even the Spice Girls if you know I said the Milky Way these are the same spirals is the Labyrinth or something similar you know they all kind of swirl around and in a do you think how does spiral doesn't just keep tightening self not necessarily labyrinths aren't excellent representation for spirit because much like a spiral they represent the Journey of the Soul just like life there's only one way in and one way out it's the same path spiraling in and out through Infinity walking the Labyrinth is my favorite way to get in touch with us. Energy the walking and switching directions is a really good for your brain and can be a meditative and hypnotic to Laswell perfect word spirit  looks like there's no beginning and no ending in the Funhouse looking through the window looking through those like back-to-back mirrors symbology the people had to represent the energy of deity or the energy of the ineffable and they would put it on goddesses they put it on Newgrange they put it on rocks and carve it into stone all over the place because this idea of the Spiral of deity is so magical the people it's a concept that has fascinated people for a very long time and another representation is back to one of your favorite shell is a mirror love both your own reflection and just the mirror itself as a liminal space I do like they do with that because it gives you that that Infinity all things are infinite means like facing each other  Xfinity Wi-Fi look at that too long at totally tripped me out that there is an Infinity to all things to live forever no but your spirit moves and we all Dust in the Wind but but I feel personally that we all continue to exist on sublevel so yeah Infinity it it it represents us crying and things like that or do you like to represent a liminal space that is spirit is if you take a very thin veil preferably something that you can see through and put that over a mirror because now you've got the duo representation of liminal spaces you've got a mirror and you've also got a veil over top of it if you shine the light on it and it's a nice then bail so you can just kind of see through to the mirror on the other side  I find it that's a really nice way if you can get yourself into an alpha meditative State and gaze into a mirror like that that's more of a representation of looking into Spirit looking into that liminal Spirit space I was going to say that gives me fives of like Crossing through the fail to having that connection with the spirit world when you do the veil over the beer that is like the greatest representation for Tiffany's we are talking about a spirit but I'll think of crossing the literal Veil yeah yeah and our brains love that our brains love when the physical representation matches the magical representation you put that mirror underneath the literal Vale your brain says who I'm crossing the veil to get to the information on the other side you are in the spirit Realm  that's spirit is more of a place that a place that I'm not a tight Circle and again it's that Circle hey this is a space out of space in the time out of time we are casting it to bring us into that realm that realm of magic that realm of other knowing and other beings into again is that Circle no beginning and no end then we cast that magical space to where we stand in the center again in that Spirit realm which does contain Spirits like ancestor Spirits land spirits but more by Spirit realm we mean magical space liminal space face of this is so hard to get really is because you know  my grandma is a spirit and I love her but when I am invoking Spirit my grandpa knows I'm not calling her he's not what I mean part of it everything is part of it but he's part of it like the all knowing all things all thing I mean all things like everything that the all of everything out of all five at like like what is what is the spark of life where did we come from where did knowledge come from how did we all of a sudden become sentient that spark is Spirit how did we go from ABE to human how do we have a podcast right at this very moment  if we can figure that out who is it are we I don't even know but if we could figure out what that Divine spark is what is that what is that stole that Center that everything that we could tell the people with Spirit more bucks oh yeah oh I love books this is the best explanation I can give you after 35 years that's all I know is going to hate this what what the best way to connect with spirit is stillness it's quiet in those Quiet Moments that was quiet you're supposed to be still how are you writing in a journal after you right after you have your quiet still moment and then you reflect on it and I really do  you should write it down you could just think it to yourself but it's going to be better if you write it down so that you don't forget right just key words right feelings but spirit is found in those moments that are hard to describe those those moments of pure perfection Spirits going to be found when you're carrying around that backpack full of journals that Layla make sure  write 50 pages a day right of page a day for every day of your life and you will find Enlightenment my child know I don't know where it is I don't know where that moment of Stillness of beautiful Perfection is but I found it I still Chase it but this one of those places where you can find spirit I really do feel that meditation and deep reflection is one of those places if your life to a place for Spirit 30 years ago isn't necessarily where I would have done 20 years ago which isn't necessarily right now so just as the world revolves our thoughts or ideas and in how we view things of Olives I was thinking about times when have I felt spirit and and we talked about times and ritual when we've invokes deity or when we've drawn down the moon or drawn down the goddess and those up  pretty special moments but I've also felt Beauty when I first met my husband that weird Divine amazingness there's been times I've been out in nature many so many thanks a lot, it's so perfect it's just so wonderful and that to me is also that Divine spark that Spirit you know it's funny that you make it sound so beautiful and romantic because not too long ago during this series actually right before we were doing the water episode we happen to have a hurricane go off the coast of Massachusetts and me and my sweet darling had to go down to the water cuz you know I love a good rager and I felt that same energy would high tide was  coming in and it was I mean the waves were bag but you know I'm from the woods so I thought they were big my sweet darling was like yeah that's amazing undeniable energy the wind the water I mean I understand that there wasn't a fire peace there but you can just it's almost like you fell everything in the universe in kind of a rage and you've got that moment of feeling Spirit it doesn't have to always be that perfect quiet moment right wild raging sometimes they're amazing moments and feeling that all that inspiration that is to me is also Spirit but sometimes standing out in the middle of wild raging storm or when the waves are crashing that can be pretty powerful and inspiring is  I can also say the same thing about when I popped out to kids so you know that was depending on you feel it at different moments in time in different ways absolutely absolutely well I said that so weird popped out two children I didn't mean that in a bad way I love them both Workaholics whatever you happen to do if you ever get into that flow state where everything just seems to be coming perfectly and it's working and and you're you're writing down everything and everything is coming together yes this is perfect for writing but yeah you do you get into that kind of that Perfection that feeling that is also spirit that feeling when everything is just right it's like the perfect storm is funny that I said that because that goes back to that can be that chaotic  The Perfect Storm can be good and bad this isn't always good energy of creation is also the most things spirit is everything it is it is the line that encompasses everything that connects all of us and everything good and bad and everything in between that's why I love that you described it as the lines of the pentacle because you see it is what creates it and I see it encompassing it all kinds of 10,000 goddesses it was a real book damn it I'm pretty sure it was that had two different covers somehow  it was such an atmosphere for our copper you just remembering that piece wrong but those two books The Witches goddess and the Book of goddesses and heroines are what we have been dismissed remembering as the book of 10000 goddesses or we fell into an alternate universe or Mandela effect or whatever but we have those two books and we will put pictures of them on our socials to try and help out but yeah I get that question a lot so I was sorry I'm sorry everybody that we had some weird Mandela effect that we've put you on like this Rabbit Hole looking for a book to exist because I can't tell you how many times I have had to type out I am so sorry Sal and I have memories like swiss cheese, we know it's just because we can't find it doesn't mean anything and just because we were having different covers doesn't mean  the last thirty years never up next will be at the Spirit meditation coming in a few days thank you guys all for your encouragement on that if you like the meditations

----------------------------------------
welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and this is the fourth episode of The Elemental Magic series and for this episode will be waiting into the magic of water water is the elements of intuition healing and emotion from the holy Wells of account to the dark banks of the River Styx water has long been part of our collective subconscious will explore the wisdom of water through its magical correspondences it's limited symbolism and it's deeply personal connection to our bodies and minds but wait I'm sure she'll and before we dive into the water like what I did that before we dive into the water we want to talk a little bit about a wonderful fabulous upcoming event Pagan Pride day it is going to be Pagan Pride day all across the world throughout the month of September so we want to take a moment and talk about what is Pagan Pride day where did it come from where is it headed and what are we doing for  Layla you and I have celebrated this for a very long time going back to the first Pagan Pride we ever attended was in 2001 almost to the beginning so far it is from what we looked it up not too long ago and found out that Pagan Pride there's rumors that has started in the early 90s like right around 1992 but there's really no documented evidence of that the first time there's really any documentation of a pagan Pride it was in the late 90s like right around 1998 and that was what three or four years before we went to our first Pagan Pride day which happened to be the very first New York City Pagan pride and sadly it was shortly after the September 11th attacks in New York city so there was really a sense of wanting to come together that solidarity  connection amongst which has like it was a deep deep experience I think both emotionally magically mentally the whole thing to it and I'm going to post pictures of baby which cell and Layla at our Pagan Pride day in New York City back in 2001 there are also going to be some 9/11 Memorial pictures in that as well because the two are intrinsically tied together in our memories wow you have pictures of me from sending posts had bright red hair  play remember that hair and I loved it I can't wait this year Pagan Pride we are going back to Central New York this group has been running a pagan Pride day for quite a few years now and we do a phenomenal job like a lot of groups you know they have their glitches and their issues mostly due to the fact that there's just a couple of them are some glitch free issue phrase saying I don't know where you're going cuz it's nowhere I've been but there won't be any vendors pretty much any Pagan Pride that you go to you're going to find a lot of interesting things going are you going to be able to meet people learn new things and buy pretty shiny things in common theme among Pagan Pride days that I think is awesome is there's generally a food drive a non-perishable canned food drive where they ask you to donate Goods  folks in need so if you are heading out to your local Pagan Pride days sometime in the month of September you know take a take a few extra fingers with you and donate it to those who don't necessarily have as much as we all do and take some time and and check out the local boobs a lot of times these Pagan fries will have not only vendors but they'll have groups from your local area that provide services maybe they provide local rituals or the local study groups you might be able to find cousins or different events in your area so check that out as definitely a great way to find like-minded people in your area also I would be remiss if I didn't say this another fun reason to go to these is the shopping is vendors are phenomenal and let me tell you I know that the man in the blue truck can get it to you in 2 days but you are not supporting your community and your local pagans that way  go to these things look at these peoples where's and if you're going to spend the dollars anyway spend them local with some of your local community because you will find one-of-a-kind items handmade items very witchee Wachee things but you will also find alter tools and some ritual supplies that you may need to snag up while you're there not everybody is lucky enough to have pagan shop in their area so might be a good way to apply up shell who goes to 15 on your lunch break I'm not I'm just super jealous  just the season folks I know you're all coming to Salem because that's what everybody does this time of year do you need any shopping tips let me know a time for all of these Pagan events to go to Salem but there's Pagan Pride events at it just seems to be that kind of year and if you are looking for connection these are great ways to connect with folks whether it's trying to find a a working coven or just a community or just people to make you not feel alone in this crazy world and to bring it back around 2 episode of topic ball is also considered to be the season of water so happy to see what I did there bring it all the way back and yeah and you know it's kind of funny because you just mentioned that you all of a sudden have the storm in your area is funny because it's not funny it's ironic that this is kind of that water time but it's also the time when is hurricane season  thunderstorms are a lot of rain is is Shifting in now and so it's almost like the Earth feels like it's it it's water phase right now you know when I sent you videos of this and we'll see if we can get some posted but I went down the other night to the shore we had a storm coming in here in the North Shore Massachusetts and there was a way of Psych there is an energy that comes in with that water it's Indescribable it's it it's this powerful it's almost like this loving cleansing force that will snap your neck in a heartbeat water has moods you know you look out at a beautiful Lake and it's classy and it's smooth and it's perfect and then you can see all the way down to the bottom and it looks so gentle and nice but then you look at Niagara Falls and the water is pouring down the sides and pound you to a pulp in a second  these different mood it's not only a shape changer in that it can go from glassy and clear to waves crashing in a heartbeat but water takes the shape of whatever you put it into and water is the only element that has all the different forms of matter just normally you can normally on the planet Earth find water in a liquid or gas or solid form and that's pretty much how I keep going back to that site I saw the other day at the beach water can be this loving and comforting cleansing thing that can engulf you and love and care but in the next breath that same water can be what takes you out you know you don't pay attention to those emotions those feelings and the elemental pieces of water that can really destroy it from the inside out they say that were made up mostly of water here is humans. 60% I mean this is the element that we should be the most attuned to it is  tied to our emotional self and I think that sometimes not enough care is taken towards that and I think people shy away from the water element because I feel like it's a reflection of ourselves yeah water is the element of our emotions of our deep subconscious and of our mind your brain itself is surrounded by water and when we talked about water taking on intention or taking on the shape of things that you put it into you know that goes back to the doctrine of signatures water is very malleable water is something that you can mold if you choose to do it so is that your emotional state and like you said a lot of times we don't choose to control that we don't choose to work with the water you know we try to ignore it or just glanced along the surface because it's easier like a skipping rock look at that pretty glass surface and not look at what's underneath and underneath water is teeming with so much  just kind of right themselves here but because our bodies are made up of water and because they can be influenced by things like say the moon pulls on the ties right and influences that water and turns it into those crashing waves well we are 60% water if we don't think the moon tugs on us I mean I think that would be silly to think that it doesn't I think most emergency room in police departments would agree with you on that theory so if we intentionally instead of ignoring it if we go into the depths of that water if we have our emotions you know we can really handle that into a good direction and get a lot of magic and energy out of it but I think like you said it's it's easy to stay on the surface and you know what I'm thinking of working with water I mean that's the stool but as far as tools that kind of lead you down that water mindset without having actual water I think of mirror  magic when I think of water I think maybe because that that surface of the mirror looks like that glass surface of a lake or or of a river or on occasion that glass surface of the ocean so this is a time where I find mirror magic to be very prevalent is when I'm working with water energies Works beautifully water wants to reflect what it shown much like a mirror does and it will happily take the shape of whatever you directed into so if you work with those qualities of divination purposely like for example scrying or working with water from ear spells you can shape the energy of that water into whatever magical tool you need are there any other tools that represent water that you like to use show vessels when I think of West alter tools and picking up vessels whether it's a cauldron or a bowl a dish a seashell dish  obviously things associated with the ocean and with with rivers and lakes and streams would be things I would potentially use on on my altar rocks is kind of an earth thing but if I put something out of a river or the ocean that may tend to be in my West quadrant of my altar as well as well glass of created by fire its Earth and fire but because it has been shaped and molded by that water carries the energy of water with it so stones that have been shaped by water glass that has been shaped even have bits of pottery that have been shaped by the water because water and time is extremely powerful you don't notice the changes that water is making as it relentlessly carbs through a roof over Years you'll see that it has changed the course of that River because it just keeps coming it just keeps going and if you don't watch it will change  the course of things that will change the shape of things because it is powerful even if it is kind of slow moving but things that I like to work with with water you mentioned earlier mirrors and because that clean your surface yeah that reflective surface with water is really great to use as a as a scrying mirror because you have that connection with the subconscious with the deep brain and so by scrying into that same as you would with fire gazing or any other type of scrying to the nation to soften your face in a relax your mind and just left those images, and it works very well because of water strong connection to your subconscious mind is also number 842 on what you can do with all that stocked up saved Moon water that is on your shelf for under your dresser that you're like what do I do with this now I'm absolutely you know that I take everything back to Devon  but I truly do and I think that for a lot of newer folks that haven't tried a lot of different methods of divination the best way to know what you're good at and what you like the mostest try them also this might be a good push to try water divination or or mere divination I mean that square intuition in our divination lives and also because water is very much a liminal space when you go through that surface you're in a whole nother World basically inside water the Celts very much feel that Holy Wells can be liminal spaces between here and another world they have a lot of association with holy rivers in holy Lakes deeply associated with land Spirits the Celts weren't the only people to think that water was a liminal space the Greeks did as well the Greeks and the Romans with the River Styx they had the whole idea that in order to get from this world into the  after all she had to cross the river I believe she was a goddess at one point I mean when were born there's the whole birth Waters right you're born in a rush of water and so they felt it when you died you also had to cross water the water itself is that liminal between life and death kind of space so it makes divination or scrying or any type of intuitive work very easy I can be a portal into that other side the obvious one that I've been thinking of that you didn't mention was Avalon you know you have to get in the boat and go through the church and the Priestess Parts the mess and then you go instead of Glastonbury Tor across the water you go to Avalon Water is very much Associated especially with women with feminine with the spirit and I think a lot of it has to do with you know from the womb you are in the waters of the womb a lot of associations there and again the waters around the brain so it until  the brain life and death water is associated with all of these things let's say one wants to get a better connection with water what would be one suggestion you would give to folks on a way they could work with the water the element of water the easiest one ritual bath get yourself into the water get your body in the water get wet you know actually ritual bath was going to be in my top two and with that what I think it is most effective for me take some flower petals sometimes it can all be rose petals folks sometimes it can be but not always flower petals some ritual oil obviously you're going to want to cleanse your bath prior to getting in and just get in and just kind of soak it all in and maybe whatever Royals you put in your ritual bathroom in flower petals for that  maybe to a means to whatever and you're looking at you know you looking for clarity or are you looking for a vision of the next steps you should take you know what is the purpose of that bath which may dictate what you put into that bath but get into the bath even if you just need a good cleansing if you just need a good cleansing showers and I do not mean that in in the take a shower you know you'll get clothes, take a shower but like there's something to be said for like when that water is just blowing at you from the head down it's just yes your kind of washing away all the literal dirt and grime but you're getting all that figurative it's almost I I look at it almost sometimes it's like an aura cleanse you know it's like showering your aura showering your space you know a good time to be able to to cut all the Ty's off yet  washing yourself you're washing yourself of those ties from that day or what have you I always like to take a shower after I've seen all the residual spiritual eckhoff me you know aside from the dirt and grime I think showers just in and of themselves are a spiritual cleansing said aside from a physical cleansing method hours are one of those amazing like-for-like magic spells that are perfect because it's so easy to visualize step in the shower water is coming down from your crown and it's flowing down your body and as it flows down your body it carries with it all the negativity all the crime all the dirt is so easy to visualize it's actually happening with this little bugger making that visual connection is super super easy with a shower so I love  showers and baths for cleansing purposes spiritual cleansing purposes for that reason and also because it's so easy to feel that water when you're feeling the physical aspect of water you're feeling the spiritual and magical aspects of it as well it can heat you up it can cool you down it can make you hydrated it can drown you it can cleanse you it can make you feel purified and uplifted it can pull you down so all these things that you feel when you're in water or with water are how you can work with it magically and do you remember she'll back when we were little witchling when we first went to a festival interesting Lee enough Brushwood folklore Center they used to have a group that went there very large group called The Church of all worlds I remember the Church of all worlds  grizzled old dudes and somebody cups of water in their hands turn to the person next to them and poured it into their hands and said water shared is life shared and the person that gave the water to see exactly it so that went around the hot tub and so when it got to us we had learned the call-and-response by that point but I had heard that originally in a book I read because I was a major nerd as a kid and I read Heinlein Stranger in a Strange Land and that's where that phrase came from the church of all worlds was created from the book Stranger in a Strange Land by over on cell and friends and it became a major movement it is still a movement I just want to support from hand to hand in that particular it was Pagan soup enough at that point there is no way in all the freaking way  host of how you would have gotten me to drink any of that water or even put my face in it I would have literally licked do off of grass before drinking a hot tub water if you can barely get me into a hot tub at a festival leave anyways that was the first place I remember seeing water very prominently displayed in a pagan ritual and it was very very important to them but water shared is lifeshare we are water you know we'd need water to survive when we're sharing water we're sharing a little bit of ourselves and this is water that has been drank and evaporated rain down upon the Earth grown into something else and through the cycle or Millennia your drinking water that dinosaurs drink this water has been around for a while and so it's that deep history it's best subconscious it's the past it's that slow mo  knowledge you know all of this is there so when you're drinking this water you're literally drinking history you're sharing life with everyone that has ever been on this planet and everyone that ever will be on this planet I think you're starting to shed some light into the review some of the reasons why I've never really been a water Drinker this right you're kind of making it less appealing is this time goes on I think of it and blesses swapping Spit with Hitler and more like a mountain I guess yeah oh God I don't know the Earth itself something cooler I don't know but I think that water is definitely an element that people shy away from that really should be I think delved into more you know you got that that mental part of air you've got that Solid Ground and part of Earth you've got that  passionate Drive of fire you need to bring that emotional sense of water into things there's four elements for a reason because we require that balance and I I think that water is always the one that came to get shunned a little bit because there is an air of mystery that can be scary but I think it should be equally delved into his as the other elements I think some of it may come from a fear of self-reflection people to tend to get nervous when things get too deep it's definitely a lot going on underneath the surface most of the time like with fire it's pretty cut-and-dry like we spoke about before you know fire it's there it's in your face it's can't be messed where is water there's just so much unknown in mystery our memories and our Deep Emotions you know it's scary in there lying around in your brain  yeah so I think that's why I sometimes we kind of shy away from it a little bit but one of the ways that I found that made working with water easier for me was which is like Moon water right absolutely everybody's got that shit out on their porches on their window sills and then not a damn one knows what to do with it afterwards so we get our cute little jar we put some water in it and we set Our intention over the water right we're like for this full moon I want charge this water with the power of the Moon and we put it out under the full moon and it gets charged and we save this phone moon is the energized mood and so I have this energized full moon water why don't we do that with ourselves if I'm 60% water why can't I put myself out under the full moon and charge myself  with the power of that full moon energy and self-love or motivation or charge myself with whatever energy intention I want in charge of the water in this cute little jar you should be absolutely I think we tend to ignore things are easier in the fire of action and outward emotion Earth that your body that are that your breath these things like you said are easy to see they're out there they're right there and our subconscious and our emotions are so much harder to work with and I think we tend to skip over that so on the next full moon set the intention that we more comfortable with the deeper parts of our magical brain and in our subconscious and treat ourselves as they're really cool jar holding the water and put ourselves out under the full moon to absorb of all of that beautiful energy still working with water there is an element of self-care that is that  you're saying exactly what I'm saying bubble bath with candles and herbs Adorn myself with crystals and herbs and oils and ghosts and sacred holy and badass if you call that self-care that's exactly what I'm doing and put yourself in front of the Moon people that's what we're saying  intentions for you you know instead of setting out that mood but you're not going to forget what it was for that that's such a great idea because I think that people sometimes tend to forget themselves in this whole mix of magic absolutely I've made Super Moon water there's been times where we've had outrageous thunder and lightning storms where I've I've done other person. I have a couple jobs full of water that I need to do something with so I am just as guilty as every other person that uses for Moon water usually depend on the energy of the moon but in general it's for purification spell work and for offering and you also mentioned stormwater and that's collected the same way that you would collect Moon Water by putting water out to absorb the energy of that storm or better yet  by putting out a container to let the storm itself fill that container with water from the storm storm water is full of the raw energy of that weather event it carries the same amount of power that Tempest did and in my opinion the more powerful the storm the more powerful the water and it's great when you need that wild Untamed energy of a storm for protection or big motivation power through something whenever you need that powerful thunder and lightning if there's anything that you would want son type energy for growth Vitality success motivation power Clarity all these things there's a lot of different types of water water is great for holding on to energy and taking the shape of what your intention is so there are a ton of different kinds of water  Aunty during the summer where you put the water out on the you know put it out on the deck and let it sit with tea bags under the sun I love that I love that so much we used to do that when I was a kid and I just love that but I don't necessarily think of that is some water because its teeth at I'm drinking but you're absolutely right at the T in there that corresponds to what you want in your life you know you want some energize peace in your life to some chamomile in meant to have a calm day where you get it done put that in the Sun and add that energize energy to the Sun so when you make your tea put it out in the sun with the intention of gathering that energy because water easily pulls and things like that it very easily poles in those energies and those intentions and it also has a lot of properties by itself you know we talked about taking showers to cleanse ourselves if you're cleansing  or if you want to get something away from you running water weather real running water of a river or your faucet or your toilet is a great way to Paul energies away from you if you magical properties of running water are change and are pulling things away it's cleansing you have no idea how many bay leaves write somebody's name on a piece of toilet paper and flush it is a very simple way to get them out of your life not just the symbology of the toilet getting that piece of shit to go away but also the symbology of the running water because running water is magical folk magic says that evil spirits can't cross running water so by using that you get that negativity away from you I have a funniest a quick funny story so it my awesome awesome part time job at one of the witchy stores downtown the big boss has a rule and he's going to laugh when he hears me  so his Rule and it involves water in the bathroom toilet seat always has to be closed why would you ask why is it so imperative that he insists the toilet seat be closed cuz he doesn't want the demons coming up man keep them demons down whatever the demons are that's up to you to imagine but keep the demons down keep the seat down because you know that's another thing people always talk about how energy use and in spirit energy scan travel Spirit travel through water protections looking up to see you off your space you would be remiss if you forgot about water lines and water connections cuz just as much as electrical lines can be a conduit for spirits to move about water can be a conduit for spirits to move about too and my boss does not want no bulshit coming out of that toilet  sound water is definitely a conduit for Spiritual energy for Spirits in our previous podcast we looked into Supernatural events and hauntings around the country I was very very surprised at how often a lot of these haunted places were on top of or very close to running water some sort of correlation it's definitely a conduit for Spirit movement so keep the toilet lid down my friends but you know also same thing when you're cleansing you know if your cleansing your space warding off space just as much as you would cleanse and seal mirrors in window ways you would do the same with faucets your toilette Etc an opening into your house they don't realize that a heat vent or a water pipe or an electrical outlet isn't opening into your house and so if you are being very serious about Warden your house people  cleanse and seal all openings of their home so yeah we don't always think about those those are just some of the things about water that sometimes people forget about because water is the one cuz no one wants to deal with that emotional when he wants to deal with that emotional shit we all want to get around that but that's the one that we really need to work with our bodies are so much water our brains are so much water by connecting with that by controlling that in harnessing that we can start to make it work for us and help us achieve our goals Waters powerful water wheels are one of the first ways that people made energy so will you know if you can harness that power it might feel slow at first but you get that Rushing Water going in there's not a lot I can stop whole wall of water that's one way to raise a lot of energy for a spell working I absolutely love water you know like I was saying before that energy that you get at the ocean you know if so  loving and caring but yet like kind of a jekyll-and-hyde it can be so destructive and horrible and you know when you look at the earth the earth is covered mostly in water we don't know what the hell is under there so it's also water is the ocean is kind of that that last mysterious all the Mysteries that are left it seems in this world are in the water right now it's been deep it's those deep dark depths that were very scared of the ones in our brain and the ones on the planet but there are also those ones that have those hidden secret jewels and gems and nuggets of wisdom and wonder in amazement is probably my favorite offering to make to any deities any land Spirit pretty much anybody that you offer water to except for maybe a purifier spirit is going to be appreciative of that water  because water shared is Life share its it makes up so much of what's on this planet it makes up pretty much everything and we all need it in some way to survive so by sharing water so you're basically saying I respect you I respect your life and that's that's a beautiful thing and so it makes a very easy simple offering to your ancestors or to your deities or or to your Spirit guides I see people all the time that are like I made this offering of food what do I do with it now or I may just offering how do I dispose of it with water you don't ever have to worry about that you can just let it evaporate you can put it out on the earth that is something that's always accepted I like the water is probably the easiest offering it is probably my second go to for offering as you are for a weed I'm not going to lie I usually roll a joint with other herbs with the intention of making the smoke my offering  I look at it as something to mean something to me but water is is definitely my second go to cuz like you said it's something that it's almost a representation of giving a part of myself as that offering you know going back to the we are made up 60% of water it's the thought of giving an offering of a piece of yourself a piece of life just makes me want to go get a drink yeah I'm kind of all right well I'm going to go to the ocean I'm going to close all my windows against this major storm that's moving in

welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to this special meditation episode of back on the broomstick I'm Layla and today we're exploring one of the most dynamic dangerous and divine forces in the witches toolbox the element of fire out of all of the elements fire is the one that we must all with intent it's the only classical elements that doesn't simply exists around us like air water or Earth fire must be created it must be invited and respected and when we constantly connect to Assassin's like through meditation we are able to awaken that Primal fire that potent energy within ourselves in myth and magic fire has always been sacred fire is both creation and destruction it is the Catalyst of great change in your magic in your rituals whenever you want to add passion power drive or creativity to your working fire energy is what you want to reach for so what does it mean to connect that sacred fire within ourselves  fire energy lives in your belly in your blood in your brain and in your heart it's the butterflies with dance in your stomach when your about to do something Brave or bold or terrifying it's that racing Restless energy that makes you Pace when you're full of ideas but you don't know where to put them it's the heat that rises to your face when you feel desire Fury or conviction fire in your body is transformation that sheet in your belly is your own personal Forge when we meditate with the intention of connecting to Elemental fire you are doing more than imagining a flame you're tapping into the fires of your own life of your own energy by using breathwork and visualization you're able to awaken that inner spark a week in the Inner Fire and feed it with your intention every inhale is are for the fire and every exhale is a release and the more you breathe with that flame the more it grows the more powerful it gets and the more  you'll begin to feel those qualities of fire rise up within you know courage passion creativity will confidence so this fire meditation is one of activation is to help you tap into all of those energies within yourself Ever Needed motivation to finish the project hello I do all the time or the energy to start one with boldness to speak your truth or to enforce boundaries fire is your ally sitting in Stillness in meditation with the Salomon allows you to commune with it safely to ask it for guidance and to raise that infernal heat so that you can turn it into action through that flame you can gain momentum and you can burn through stagnation just like a lantern with a flame inside of it you can light the path forward one of the beautiful and yet also difficult lessons about fire is that transformation doesn't require you to be perfect  don't require you to be the best it just requires Fuel and that fuel can be your desire your grief your raid Your Love fire will accept all of that it will transform the energy that you give it so that you can direct it in the way that you want to go direct it to your desire your will so I'm going to do this meditation to help you connect with that inner fire to help you raise that energy so that the next time you need a little boost or passion for inspiration or for the strength to stand up and be bold that you can let that fire speak to you that you'll have that relationship with fire so you can call on it you can raise it within you so that when needed that fire can fill you with strength and energy and remind you that you are powerful you're wild and radiant that you control that fire that you are the flame  I guess meditation as usual find a comfortable spot take a moment to set up your space decorate the area with items that remind you of fire maybe some red or orange Fabric and if you can do so safely you could light a candle or two and also I recommend having some food and water on hand for after the meditation something to help ground you and bring you back to the physical space to find a comfortable position either sitting or laying down and let your body relax as you sink into your spot and prepare for the meditation once you're ready if you feel comfortable doing so close your eyes  let your breath come just as it is  you can just be as you are no need to change anything  simply be here settling and starting to relax  going to Simply Begin by noticing your breathing  continue to breathe normally pay attention to your inhale and exhale and as you breathe through your mind as a clear Open Sky  occasionally thoughts may come Drifting by like smoke see them and let them pass  is no need to follow any thoughts that may arise just observe and let your breath clear away any Rising smoke  and on your next Frost inhale deeply through your nose better in health breast fill your belly your Center where the fires of creation live and exhale gently is if you're blowing across Embers  again breathing slowly through your nose you're the air entering your body are that feeds the fire of life

welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and welcome to part three of our five-part Elemental Series this episode focuses on the elements of fire fire is bold passionate transformative and working with the energy of fire can help give your practice that extra energy boost you may have been looking for and getting super excited about the fire the passion and I just can't help it and Layla I would like to talk and open this episode with a brief conversation about the moon for a minute so we can talk about the movie can absolutely talk about the moon for minute I'm glad you brought up the moon because I have an interesting coincidence coming up in my life involving the upcoming new moon actually now before you tell me about your coincidence funny you mention the new moon so prior to a skidding on you mentioned something that I've never heard of and I would like to talk about this with the people  so people we're going to discuss what is a black moon all right so I was on the old Reddit and actually later in the episode I have a question that someone on the back on the broomstick subreddit ass and we'll talk about that but I saw a bunch of people asking what are you going to be doing for the black moon right now because I'm feeling old because I'm not sure what's going on so I was confused myself I thought you know Black Moon Dark Moon new moon maybe they're just talking about the new moon and I was kind of right they are talking about the new moon so Black Moon explain this to me because I'm having a wrapping my head around it and I had to look this up because I never heard of a black movie actress sure why so if any of my astrology friends out there know if this actually doesn't see you that make this new moon kind of special email us actually  if you happen to know when astrology guy and he happens to be a little sooner so I'm going to hit hit my my buddy Tim up and ask him and on earthsky.org I did find that black moon is a relatively new term this came up probably in the 1980s and it may have started as a Wiccan wait we were wiccans in the 90s and I still never heard of a black moon the gasses that possibly wiccans in the eighties coin Black Moods mean the second new moon in a month much like a blue moon you heard of a blue moon good ones and a right once in a blue moon is when there is thirteen full moons within the 12-month period and that  13th moon is the Blue Moon yes that is one definition of a blue moon and it was also misrepresented back in the 40s 1940s I believe it was mistakenly thought to be the second full moon in a month so now sometimes people will say a blue moon is the second full moon in a month so their does colloquially what people say a word but that's not what this particular Black Moon is one of the other definitions is a seasonal Black Moon which happens about every thirty-three months according to earth guy they say that it's the third of 4 new moons in a season only happens every 33 months and that's the one that's happening this particular August 23rd so I'm not sure if there's any  Titian all magical oomph to this is what we're saying the same qualities as any new things sometimes that can be when you send stuff off to the void particularly if you got that moment of the Darkmoon exactly sometimes it's great to meet to do that so maybe the special event just means that that energy has Amplified similar to a blue moon so I guess I would treat it is the Blue Moon of dark Moon's maybe special maybe it's not you'll have to go out on that night or around that night and feel that energy for yourself and see if it feels any extra specially to you I know I'll be out checking it out she has just always special to be honest now what I found my new bestie Shannon and I are starting the community in Corning New York  our meet-and-greet day as August 23rd and it just so happens to be the day that a local group is doing a pagan pipe Moonlight Oddities Market in the area and it's the black moon we're kind of excited about that I think that just means auspicious beginnings and I'm very excited to start something new on the new moon now you had to say it so I just want you to Quick tell people's where and how they can be a part of this group we have started this is going to be a learning Class A meet-and-greet if he can get together the first Saturday of every month although in September we're starting the 2nd Saturday but the first meeting is August 23rd and it's just kind of a meet-and-greet get to know people and it'll be at the southeast Steuben County Library in Corning I will also be having rituals sabots and SP  at The UU Church in Big Flats as well so we're going to be doing all sorts of things are some local businesses that might get involved shell might get involved were going to have all sorts of workshops were going to be doing some great things in the area but I have a feeling I'll make a surprise appearance now and again you better I will you know I will it wouldn't be the same without you and you'll be posting stuff on our socials so if folks are looking to catch that in person please do Cuz I'm super jelly that I can and definitely send the message if you want to reach out to Layla or the Crystal City Circle book group if you are in the area and want to join that as well so it's pretty cool I'm excited new things are happening I'm seeing red I'm seeing Orange what's that mean  and fire is fabulous for this topic because you know it's that fire under your ass because you're going right it's that fire of determination it's the passion to start new things so how fitting you know actually now that you say that that his damn fit in there itself has been something that people have reached for for literally thousands of years by your head came to people we learned how to cook food with every time and days we learned that it kept the scary things in the nighttime away we could use it to defend our homes we could use it to defend our families we could use it to keep ourselves warm in the winter time so that Memaw doesn't freeze to death and it made a difference and it was magical that difference was so big it was magical to people with powerful  Life by your is life and fire was protection and it banished evil and it was very clear to see that this magical creature this creation that breathes and eats and grows would protect me if I was careful with it and that's the other cool thing about fire is out of the four basic elements fire is the only one that will hurt you if you touch it it can also protect you it can also cleanse you it's kind of a go to and the other thing with fire is it's the only one that's not easily found in nature are is everywhere water Earth everywhere fire requires something special it requires lightning it requires friction it requires something extra and that's why there's a lot of myths involved with fire as well all the stories about how people got fire involve tricking a god usually or some type of theft  Prometheus yeah isn't that wild Prometheus in Greek myths he stole it from the gods he was kind of mad at them anyways cuz I think they killed all those family or something and so he brought it to humans even though he was punished greatly for Fraternity for bring you fire to humanity there's a lot of Native American legends in Cherokee Legends grandmother spider I think a couple other creatures try to steal fire but grandmother spider is able to steal it and puts in a clay pot and brings it down to people and give it to them so that they can be warm through the winter if it's all over the world there are so many but they're all involved fact trickery of some kind but you had to take fire because Fire doesn't just exist if you get lucky each of people might have stumbled across tree that had been struck by lightning that had fire but you don't usually just stumble across fire its special it's magical  is beneath our feet you know we've talked about are aerosol around us it's what we fire is something we must seek out we must obtain it's not just there and in your condition in your coven tradition is Celtic and they they do things in threes it's the sky the Sea and the land and all the fyre festival well you know fire is still super super important even in that tradition extremely important and every tradition but I think maybe different Traditions as they should kind of put different emphasis on what is what is there priority might not be the right way to say we're going through at the time you know you you look at what the Native Americans were going through isn't necessarily the same is say what the Vikings were going through different climate you know different  a different landscape so there are going to be more focus on one or two or three more so than another one or two or three differences they all still have similar stories of someone feeding fire from the gods to bring the people I think that's really cool but that's a Common Thread instead of stealing fire when we talked about working with fire so this is why fire has been so fascinating to people they used it for protection it has protective qualities because you know if you light a candle in a dark room it immediately feels warmer and safer and and a little nicer but it also takes away the Shadows it takes stray so you get that warmth from it but you get that illumination from it you can do divination with it there's there's a lot to be garnered from fire  I was thinking you know when we we had talked about fire was our next topic I was like cheese you know where am I going to take this conversation was fired because I always start with candle magic candle magic with fire is so accessible and it's so potent there's someone so much you can do with it well when I think the thing I liked about fire magic the most and you you hit the nail on the head with a accessible you know I know we have a lot of folks that are still inside the broom closet they have to be cognizant of who knows you know what they're doing and in in such and you can burn a candle and have it be very non witchy for an outsider to see and you can put a lot of intention into that you can add herbs you can put sigils on it you know whatever the case maybe you can do a lot of magic with a candle without someone in the outside world knowing what you're doing  so I find it to be super accessible as it is a means to connect with magic and connect with the fire element or just Elemental Magic and general firing candles to me is a really big go to a lot that we had mentioned earlier so passionate it's Drive its transformation which is a good one talk about Earth Transformers things too and it's fun and a lot of a lot of Wheels like Earth is north and fire is South like they're in balance with each other and they're both transformative elements the Earth transforms things really really slowly I was just going to say I think whichever you choose to use for transformation was going to depend on how quickly you need that transformation because is going to be the slow roll it slow painful roll  my opinion when you transfer with it some more gentle transformation where is when you transfer energies that should say the jobs going to get done in a quick like fashion you know sometimes you got to get burn to move forward and was holding it back and then New Growth can start again it is that destructive and creative Force it's a destructive cleansing and sometimes sometimes we all need a little destructive thing in our lives I think that sometimes fire is the most blunt element to work with you know you work with water it's very gentle Earth is very calm but are is very pointed and to the point and get the job done and you know no sugarcoating things no beating around the bush it's just point A to point B with nothing hold  back in the middle very pointed and it's one of those because that transformative purifying can switch to destruction yeah and painful in an instant if this control and the respect isn't there and you know ironically enough that's that's kind of part of the the association I give it when it comes to you know passion love and lust which can often times be associated with fire because passion love and lust can be the greatest in the worst have some we've all been there you can be so high and so happy and it can drop you to the depths of Despair so yeah I can bring it to your knees and soul out of your nostrils  are you been there but you know fire can also then is a part of that transformation kind of burn that stuff you need to shed that stuff you need to get behind you you need to get past that you need to move forward and that transformative fire can also as much as it can kind of burn you it can then like you said clear the way for bigger better and greater transformation is not always easy and it's not always slow and you don't have a deck of tarot cards you don't have your Oracle deck you don't have your rooms are whatever it is that you use  you can always fall back on fire as well as a form of divination and in I guess where my point in saying this is is I've sometimes looked at the element of fire is a gateway between this world and the other world and divination is a good way to utilize the element of fire to kind of crossover that Gateway and if you know as you would if you were doing a reading or he knows throwing ruins or whatever divination you use just as you and I know we've done episodes are we talked about Maris crying is crying and Flame is equally useful and effective and because of that fire is an element that I see is a bridge between the worlds I love that you called it a portal or Bridge because the fire is one of those things that it's very easy for people to get into an alpha State like how often have you caught yourself have you  someone stare into a fireplace or stare into a camp fire or a candle flame it's so easy to just kind of unfocused your case and get lost in the moment and zone out and send it to me before you know what you've been staring into that fire and just all these things are popping into your head just kind of softly here and there and you don't even know where your brain is going because it's so easy to get into that meditative State just buy softly gazing into a fire and you know what's funny you mentioned like the campfire cuz my mind wasn't thinking that in the moment but I can send back to many a time and I know you've been in the same mental state community and we're either sitting around that ritual fire or dancing around the fire or drumming around that ritual fire doing the same thing and it's almost like  because it was a ritual fire in the atmosphere that we created right that are round that fire but you stare into that fire long enough you do transport yourself to another place and all right I'm going to tell the story I was going to save this for some day when we had genital Andrew on the show to talk about avalani and magic for this is so fitting for here I got to tell her now back in the day when I was a young witchling I was the only witch that I knew for a long time and then I went to Salem Massachusetts and I met some other witches and I also managed to meet someone at my college she and I started working together and we decided we were going to do like a challenge before we dedicated ourselves and I had a friend who had some land and we hopped on a four-wheeler at night and we went driving across these fields now this was I don't know early summer I guess and we're going across these fields and a lot of them  separated by 3 line so we come through these trees into an open field and she'll I have never seen so many fireflies in my entire life as I saw that night it was thick you almost had to swim through the fireflies to get unfortunately we have a look at these fireflies it was so magical but we continued on and we got to the woods where we're going to spend the night and they had a little Treehouse that was there a little fire pit and everything and we went off into these little walks in the woods and then we came back and we have some bread and cheese and we built a little fire for the evening the evening by to open Avalon we wanted to open the gateway to Avalon I don't know what we were thinking we hadn't even planned this was like a spur-of-the-moment thing or just like  oh we did to all my goodness so we pulled in all these energies and we had this incense like those loose incense we had created and we tossed it in the fire as work opening this Gateway and it was just a handful of some herbs it wasn't even that much and it was very very Smokey up here have zero clue what actually happened I have no explanation for that so I'll get there hold on so the flame seem to get bigger like we have thrown extra Log on the Fire or something and the smoke started pouring out of the fire we kind of looked at each other and when we looked back through the Smoke on the other side of the fire I could see what look like 45 inch round lily pads it looks almost like lily pads to me glowing bright green  single-file going from where the path was just beyond our fire pit curving off in between two trees where it disappeared my jaw dropped I had no idea what that could be I looked at her and I saw that she was looking in the same area I was now this friend was a little bit of a you know tend to exaggerate things but I was just going to say I actually now that the more you tell this I've actually heard this story and I heard it from the person you went with yeah and I've actually heard it almost word-for-word how you're saying it from her now I was not going to say anything because I wanted to know for sure that she was seeing what I was thinking she says are you seeing green glowing lily pads on the other side of the fire I was like holy shit yes I do and my first thought was owed am I going to follow them and then she goes I'm not going are you going  just right then I thought if I go I'm not coming back and I said no I'm not going exactly then they disappeared oh my God we ran over with our flashlights and could find nothing no Foxfire Moss no phosphorescent anything no paint no markings no nothing neither of us had any clue what it had been I still to this day other than maybe we did open a gateway to Avalon I do not know what happened because we actually have done that before us separate from this story so I do believe that you probably did that day when we did it I didn't see any green glowing lily pads and unfortunately I was like you know why didn't I go but yeah so that's one of those fires crying things did we put ourselves in a hypnotic State and happened to see the same thing maybe did we open a paw  to Avalon looking into flames by scrying in those flames you can get yourself into an alternate state of mind and get yourself very easily into a meditative Alpha state where then divination comes very very clear do you have any particular ways you like to do fire divination who what when where and why if I say out in the woods you know like we had been you're just kind of in a ritual fire and it just starts coming to you you just let it go there's been times where I have purposely okay let me see let me have a conversation with the flame here and you know more often than not if I'm doing that I'm doing a candle flame and a lot of it is just kind of feeling that energy of the fire you know I do I know it hurts but I generally if I'm going to do something I working with the element of  or I will put my hand where you're from and maybe put it on the flame a little bit kind of lick the flame I guess is the best way to say it let the flame lick you let the flame like me but just kind of getting in tune with that life force energy that he what does that heat mean are you bringing that heat to you know your love life we bring that heat to definition you know what are you bringing that into a kind of focusing in on that you don't have to visualize is match with fire I don't think you know what are you know obviously you know are is all around you but you're like my feeling it am I feeling it but with fire there something it's something that you can you can feel that he you can see that flicker you know you can't always feel that calmness and that you know solidarity of the Earth  you know you know there's dirt under your feet but that's about it you know you see that flicker of the fire and you feel all that energy emanating to use that our your spouse or or to power your divination if that's what you're doing I know you're going to hate this but I highly recommend any type of fluid and have something to write with right there or have your phone on to record because sometimes especially if I'm doing flame divination I find it very easy for me to go into trance with flame so I don't like to use fire for General divination because I tend to go too deep with fire it's super super easy for me to get very very close to that beta brainwave state where you're very much in a trance State I wouldn't be doing divination for others I'm just saying that because of being in that deeper trance State and that that can happen very easily for some people harder for me to remember what I said in a deeper to  I'm state so it's really nice to have someone record you or if you can write down or have someone else write down whatever you say cuz you might forget it's almost like a dream state and so those Visions can quickly go out of your mind afterwards so to having a way to record it as soon as you can either while you're in that trance day and getting those messages or mediately afterwards is vital because it's so easy to forget when you kind of get in that very deep fryer trance are you literally trying to tell the listeners to get ready now I'm telling you to double your journaling get a buddy to do it with you if you really that far deep into that into that trance state if you really do get very deep especially with something like fire divination you might not be able to write it down yourself you might be able to say it so having something like your phone or whatever to record you or to have someone else write it down  or you can be very helpful so yeah I guess I'm telling you to journal with a friend just so we don't so we don't forget to kind of mention this cuz we've talked about correspondences with all of the other elements that we've touched on so far so I just want to talk a few minutes correspondent says girl here so I like to think of my and a guy that's going to depend on what's my intent are we going rose petals and love are we going cayenne pepper says you kind of equate to the element of fire not necessarily flame fire but the element fire and peppers and he meant and pepper I like meant because it's there's a bite to it but it's not as sharp as if you want just a little bit of a little bit  little bit of passion you need a nudge Memphis good for that you know you don't want the burn of pepper but for Stones I like pyrite Fool's Gold is one of my favorites I love that partly because Pyromania pyrite I don't know if they really have the same basis but they sound the same so I like it plus it's sparkly and also Carnelian I love Carnelian is a firestone I have a cool little spell pause for you using a fire basically even though it's a stone so one of the things you can do have you ever been doing a spell where you have to burn a candle for a long time and you don't have time to burn it all the way down you can take a Carnelian and have it paused that spell for you in the way you do it is to take the Carnelian and you hold it up against the flame you don't have to touch the plane but hold it right next to the flame of the candle that you're  and say the flame be gone the spell lives on and then douse the flame with the Carnelian and just set the Carnelian there next to the candle and the Carnelian will hold the flame of the spell until you're able to come back and finish burning the spell I love that I actually love that and that great it's the stone is that right it's that slow it's going to hold it for you but it's still the flame Carnelian so I can hold that energy of fire so it'll pause that spell for you until you come back then just touch the stone to the candlewyck and thank the stone for holding a flame and say the spell carries on and then Spike the wiccan off Hugo know I also want to mention for me this is amazing you know on the altar Salinas firefighters firefighters South South is red flame fire South red  the maze in the South some people might like to have worms in the South I'd also don't mind I am a convert I have said in the past that I didn't like them but I am now convert to electric battery candles you know sometimes we got to do what we got to do and we've used them and they were I mean it's not a fire we get it but you know when you're trying to do a ritual and get a hotel conference battery operated they were fabulously and I've used them several times on altars and they are wonderful representation electricity is a form of the element of fire and the battery is creating electrical charge so I can see it like it's not the warmth in the flame that I'd like a lot of but like I got the whole battery how you can associate the battery piece to Fire and if you can't have a flame you can even bring up a fire on YouTube and I think that works perfectly fine  do what you gotta do  okay I have an exercise for people to work with fire energy to begin to feel by our energy and like a lot of these things this one involves another element again the breath so for this particular decided to recommend that you use a real candle in a real flame so make sure that you use all safety precautions but that and being a safe quiet place you might want the room to be a little damn or a little dark I mean we are working with a candle flame here and you want your focus to be directly on the Flames to buy lowering lights you can eliminate a lot of the visual distractions around you and it'll make it easier for you to keep your focus just on the flame so save your space with a candle in front of you with your lighter or matches and take a few deep breaths to settle yourself and then focus on the candle and just think about flame and the energy of fire is being the reason that you're there because deep studying breath in through your nose and imagine that are going to the fire in your belly the fire at the center of you  almost like a Bellows you know stoking that fire with it in a little bit and then breathe out through your mouth and feel how that cool air that came in through your nose has transformed a little bit In the Heat of your body and it's just ever so slightly warmer and once you feel centered at your lighter and light the candle you can say something if you want you don't need to it could just be I call to the spirit of fire I welcome you here in this teaching moment but you can say whatever you want or nothing at all Begin by looking at the flame just gently fix your Gaze on the flame don't stare hard as soft and steady or even allowed to but just look at the flame notice it notice the colors look for that study base that shall mention earlier look for the flickering blue the flickering orange watch How It's answers on the way I would Breathe  then as you notice the flame flickering and shifting pay attention to your breath and how close your breath is to that flame so this time as you inhale I want you to intentionally exhale or is the flame so as you're looking at this flickering flame inhale and imagine that the warmth of that plane is coming in and then as you exhale carefully you don't want to blow it out just gently carefully exhale and notice as the flame move in reaction to your breath  so the next time you do it do it with intention readin slowly about a four count so as you're breathing in read in the warmth of that flame the energy the creation the safety whatever energies you're feeling as you look at that plane free those positive energies in and watch and see if that affects the flame at all and then breathe out gently 6 7 or 8 count against don't blow the flame out but just gently breathe out in the direction of the flame and breathe out and release stagnation the doubt any negative energies that you're holding within them gently to the flame and then watch the flame Flicker and move as it burns away that negative energy or you can breathe in the positivity light radiant and then breathe out to that flame whatever you no longer need attention  exhaustion apathy year was let it go feed that to the flame you might begin to feel the flame at the core of your belly begin to warm up a little bit with this exercise begin to match the energy of the flame dancing on the candle in front of you once you start to feel that connection was you start to feel that warm as fries for a little bit with the candle just feel those energies that bond between you and the flame as you both breathe in and out and then just kind of left that go for a few minutes 35 minutes is fine and then sank the flame you can say whatever you want if nothing else fire loves boldness and honesty so be bold be honest they whatever you want you to the flame and thanks to Flame First Energy for its lesson for its light and put out the candle know some people have it too stinks ideas on how you should put out a candle some people say  you should never blow out a candle because that's disrespecting the flame with are they say you should always snuff it but then there's people that say you should never snuff a candle be cuz that's disrespecting the flame with her so maybe you should lick your fingers and snuff it but oh wait that's water so I say use whatever Implement will most safely but that flame go back to his Elemental energy whatever way you like works just fine so put out the candle and then journal or through Flex on how you felt on any insights or any thoughts that you have it or did you feel it up in any way that you feel ready to burn away something what projects or what new ideas are ready to ignite to put all that in the journal put it all down and this is a simple exercises you can do with a fire maybe you want to do it in the morning before you do your journaling or in the evening before you do your tarot pulse but it just a moment to work with the flame and to feel that fire energy so do you have any other  bells or anything like that that you like to do you spell work that I like to do is sometimes you just got to be done with stuff and I'm a fan of writing things down and burning of them maybe it's the Pyro in me I don't know but you know maybe you need to banish a thought or an idea or a person out of your life and writing that down on a piece of paper or a bay leaf or whatever the case may be and burning it in that fire you know there's something to be said for that even if it just soothes my soul watching it go up in Flames there is nothing faster than fire and it's usually permanent whereas if you want someone out of your life and you put them in the freezer for a freezer spell you know a son saw them and I still got to deal with them at some point cuz they're in your freezer but if you burn that paper that connection is severed could be a saw or an idea or a pattern that you want to kick or you know habits you're trying to get rid of you know we we know that I'm  smoker you know maybe I'm going to get to the point where I don't want to smoke anymore and I'll write that shit down and there's something in my mind to be said for burning of thought and idea whatever the case may be in having that flame released at 5 or that spell out into the universe and like you said it's like it's kind of like do this now you know a very permanent thing there's no going back so like I said I don't have like a phrase or anything to give folks but you know if you're looking to put something behind you to banish something to be rid of something I once taught and words into it speak to the candles speak to the universe talk about how you are looking to push this thing I thought idea person whatever the case may be out of your life and then burn that shit that's also something that if we're talking about getting rid of Spell components if you have put out an offering or if you have done a spell disposing of that spell  proper way that matches the intention of your spell is important and so sometimes at the end of the spell you might want to burn all of the components are the best way to release the spell is to burn that shit remember to burn things safely only burn things that you should be on one incident here people requires the which to pay attention it requires your respect it requires you to be careful it requires you to pay attention you know as much as we think of fire in circle or you know in a work as a component of our magic you know how I was raised I would be remiss if I did not say if you have permanent ritual space it might not hurt you to have a fire extinguisher on hand because you never know  my coven love these folks we have a fire blanket in our ritual area because you don't know fire is to be respected because fire decides what it cleanses sometime it's not you and we do not ever want to see any harm come to any folk so be safe people and I like to think that that transfers over to the magical realm as well as one of those energies that if you're not in control of it it will be in control of you so working with it can be very powerful it can bring you one of the places that can get you up off your butt it can give you that energy it can give you that full list that passion that drive take you down to burn you out if you're not careful if you put too much passion into a project you might not be able to finish it you might find that you put so much energy into it  it's not going anywhere or have you put all that energy into this project and now you don't have energy for anything else in a wire for anything else or to finish the project fire can quickly go from this amazing beautiful bonfire thing is out of control and consuming everything so what you're saying is you need a literal and a spiritual fire blanket with you that's right just like if you're going to be spending foyer at a festival or spending fire you always have a spotter you know all those good metaphors buddy oh gosh yes you need a fire buddy and a journaling buddy lots of buddies speaking of bodies I'm going to completely derail this and I'm going to go to a Reddit question for you lay it on me and our subreddit waxing moon 13 was talking about the elemental series that we've been doing here and they said that they were curious how we as to are  sign connect to each of the elements my first thought was to my element is a Taurus and he grounds my area perfectly and keeps me in Balance I do think I tend to work with Earth a lot more so even than are there I think I like the groundedness and the earthiness the centeredness of the element I work with that one pretty good but you do funny story so I'm an air sign you know are is probably the one I have the hardest time connecting with it's almost like I am like an alien to to my Association here and you know are is associated with east east is associated with yellow yellow is like my least favorite color or like somehow is  it's it's difficult for me it's difficult I feel like I was like my my Gemini twin was a fire sign first time I called an element in public was East are for the Pekin community that we both worked with and I thought that was very fitting and very cool but are to me seems almost too easy so I asked I also tend to avoid it a little bit just because it feels like eating this is easy I've always been a fan generally of either Earth in the North or West Water kind of that roots in the ground you know my feet are Doug and you know that solid that Oak Tree in the woods kind of thing my husband strongly because we need that groundedness I think that really helps to balance us and water you know I really I feel that I've been flow that that Evan flow I think of him  Landon me with such an emotional mess or I'm that conscious State of Trance head writer you know it's one of the other day I think you know I've always been okay with fire as well and in the South I just I've had a problem with East I always have we generally would call in familiars animal familiars and such as we called quarters like I would even have a hard time with like those associations with these feathered creatures scare me I just I don't know what my issue is with all things to East all right so I'm really easily for most people and I am no different emotions I think and the correspondences of fire are powerful and they're easy to see and feel emotions like anger are associated  with fire and anger is often the very first thing that we feel in a scary or frustrating situation because it's quick it's easy and sometimes in a dangerous situation that anger that quick action can see her life but those quick by your emotions are very often like a fire hose a literal flamethrower under Roofing volcano with no control and especially as an air sign I admit I'm a little angry sometimes so working with that fire in a productive way takes time and dedication so that you can pull in all the energy of that raging Inferno fine-tune it and direct it and make it a laser I agree but you know I think you'll recall a Time way back when I spent some time working with Pele and you know I am very very familiar with the explosive element that fighter bring into life and I think that sometimes with fire I almost look at it is the calm  send the chaos because fire can be very chaotic and when you look at a flame. Outside of that flame is dancing around chaotically but that inner white core is steady and steadfast in the middle will all of the rest is dancing around so sometimes there is some peace to be found in the chaos before fire to thrive it needs air so are in fire are always kind of I think closely associated because of that that piece of 41 to fully Thrive it does require the other it's also easy to raise energy for fire without using fire run you can dance you can get your heart rate up get a little sweaty if you can raise the heat on your body you raise the energy of fire just makes it very accessible that way and it's also easy visualization for a lot of people cuz a lot of people because  you heard that that fire in your belly you know that's a phrase people of her throughout life for a long time so they can I get what you're saying that so I think that sometimes visualizing fire without fire tends to be easier for people and you know your talk to respect it because it's dangerous but at the same time we have that ancient knowledge that is what keeps us safe and I think that's another reason why people can scry into a campfire so easily because that primitive brain says oh there's a fire here this fire will keep you safe and warm and protected and so it's easier to kind of slipped into that subconscious meditating brain is very very life and death  me to re Mansion we've got to love this coming spooky season we've decided to have a seasons of The Witch give away because we also love you just as much as anyone who sends US mail to our PO box that is postmarked between August 8th and October 1st will get an entry into our drawing what happens if there a benefactor Layla if their benefactor they are automatically entered and if your benefactor and you send in mail you can get two entries but only benefactors are allowed to have multiple entries everyone else can only enter one entry per person on October 10th we will take all of the eligible entries and we will do a random drawing and one lucky winner will win new seasons of The Witch Stalin Oracle so send us mail drop us a line  send us a letter send us a postcard you need to actually include your name and address because so we are going to need a clear name and address in case you are the winner Layla and I literally it's the two of us we do everything involving this show we are not taking your address and doing anything with it I promise you that it is for this purpose only but send us something and you know I love getting mail I love going to the PO box it's such a thrill when we get stuff this giveaway is void where prohibited and only eligible entries will be counted in the drawing for the full official rules please see our website back on the broomstick cam or click on the link in the show description of any of our Elemental series episodes and in the meantime we are going to continue with this Elemental series we have  coming up water and spirit and of course we will have the fire meditation coming out in a few days and eye out for that do you know I'm really excited because I think that  we're saving the best fun to for a last elements preference in its new tune in next week for one of shells favorites and in the meantime they wisest a wicked and don't get burned but keep it with qi

welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a back on the broomstick meditation series I'm Layla and this is the air meditation companion episode 2 Elemental series number 127 are energy more than inspiration incense and intuition will be working with the breath and your breath is very powerful not just magically but physically as well and the meditation that were presenting here will focus on your breath and breathing as a way to raise the energies associated with are like Tranquility inspiration and Clarity of communication as well as to help calm the body and 2D stress in this meditation I used two different breathing techniques not just because of a connection of breath with elemental are energy but because for some people meditation can sometimes field trip especially when our minds are racing or spiraling thru to do list old conversations random worries the crap we said six years ago one of the best  Phase 2 study and to calm that wandering mind is by giving it a job focusing on your breath gives your brain something to do it's like oh I'm breathing I'm counting now and just like that there's no room for those intrusive thoughts to take over breathing also works as a relaxation tool because your body has incredible system called the autonomic nervous system and it includes two part one that kicks into gear when you're in danger or stress called your sympathetic nervous system new fight or flight and one that soothes and restores you and that one's called your parasympathetic nervous and by slowing our breath especially when we make it deeper and more intentional we send a signal to the body that says you are safe now it's okay to let your guard down and relax. Make sure parasympathetic system respond by activating the rest and digest mode of your body it releases chemicals to help you rest and relax it's your body's way of react  to being at home being safe and being in a relaxing environment so are brothels are most accessible connections the energy of air of tranquility and inspiration and we just a few intentional inhales and exhales we can calm the chaos invite Clarity and anchor ourselves in our body and in the present moment meditation we're going to work with two different breathing techniques the first one is called a physiological stye or sometimes the parasympathetic sky and it's basically a double inhale and then a full exhale inhale twice through the nose first like 3/4 of the way and then one short quick inhalation to finish filling your lungs then you exhale slowly through your mouth kind of like a deep sigh and Studies have shown that this type of breathing is one of the most effective breathing exercises to reduce stress and to elevate your mood now the second breathing technique in the meditation is what I like to call Mantra breathing  it's another type of breathing that activates your parasympathetic nervous system in this one you're exhalation is about twice as long as your inhalation and I like to pair that with a short manttra be here now by Rome. One of my favorites and we use that in this particular meditation so for your inhalation you'll save be here for about a count of two and then say now as you exhale for about a count of four don't stress the numbers in the counting too much just try and let your body naturally breathe out about twice as long as you breathing so inhale be here and then exhale now on a long time and always remember to listen to your body if it any point you feel lightheaded or dizzy just returned to a natural breast stay with the meditation but just breathe normally and pay attention to your breath as we work through the rest of the meditation breathwork should feel comfortable and should make you feel energized and uplifted not overwhelmed not stressed out just follow a rhythm that feels  and study for you so find a quiet space where you can sit or lie comfortably preferably one where you can feel the air move maybe by a window at fan or if you're lucky outside under the Open Sky you could light a white or yellow candle if you'd like burn some incense have something scented nearby that you really like a little bit of music something gentle in the background but if it's distracting you don't need anything like that the important part is to open your senses to the air around you all right once you found that spot let's begin  settle into your spot and when you're ready if you feel comfortable doing so close your eyes  let your breath come just as it is there's no need to change anything yet simply Begin by noticing your breathing  as you pray make sure or pretend that your mind is a clear blue sky with clouds of thought Drifting by  any thoughts that come just let them be let them pass  there's no need to follow them no need to worry about them just observe them and let the wind carry them away  attention to your breathing  inhale through your nose let that inhale fry fill your belly  exhale slowly through your mouth and noticed your breath as it passes your tongue and your lips  you're the sound your breath makes in the world maybe it's quiet and small or loud and takes up space or somewhere in between  if notice and pray and listen to my voice  your breath is a powerful Ally and intimate connection to the energies of are of thought and communication we breathe most of the time without thinking about it a powerful process that happens beyond our awareness but if we pay attention if we connect to our breathing and work with the air we can unlock a powerful way to call my body and open our mind now attention again to your breath  are you then gently through your nose until your lungs are just about full egg one quick sip of air to fully fill your lungs exhale slowly through your mouth long smooth soft like a freeze signs are the trees Raven slowly and then breathing quick to fill your lungs  exhale slowly through parted lips letting it go  one more time inhale to your lungs are almost full and then one last Quick breath to fill them and exhale slowly let it all melt out in the longest slowest breath yeah  now breathe normally  as you breathe normally you may feel your body soften relax and lower your shoulders  relax and soften your jaw your breath becomes your connection to peace to tranquility  now picture or pretend that you are standing in an open field at dawn the sky above you is painted with pale blue and silver light and the air is just beginning to stay cool and crisp during the scent of newness and possibility you feel that Grace your skin dental and invigorating  let us imagine winds swirl around you now let it lift your thoughts like leaves on a Braves carrying away the noise the static the stories but no longer serve  soon we will begin a mantra I sure in hell while saying be here and exhale completely Mustang now be here a mantra carried on the Wind he here  as you inhale imagine you're breathing in Clarity like cool clean are sweeping through the halls of your mind each year  would each exhale the fog lift your thoughts settle perhaps a sense of openness begins to unfold  continue to chant continue with your Mantra breathe and short exhale long be here now  be here now  ideas gently awaken Words May begin to line up ready to be spoken when the time is right he here breathing and chanting with intention at your own natural pace  be here now  you are riding the current of thought and spirit and breath with each inhale continue to call in Tranquility inspiration Clarity and with each exhale you continue to release what no longer serves  now when you are ready take one deep grounding breath  carefully  continue to breathe normally at the edges of your awareness begin to return slowly kindly gently bring your awareness the space around you to serve as supporting you the air that wraps itself around you like a familiar Shaw the scents and sounds of Life carried on fries  there is no rush but presents return like a whisper not a command  wiggle your fingers your toes  scratch your body  notice the air against your skin the rhythm of your natural breath steady calm all of magic and life  but the energy of air stay with you let it live in your lungs in your voice and in your thoughts  when you are ready open your eyes and let every breath your reminder you are here awake you are inspired now  take your time and slowly come to awareness stand up and stretch if you have some water or some tea something to eat something to help you come back to your body to hear and now and whenever you need or want to connect the energy of air to the magic of inspiration of clarity and Tranquility just remember your breath breathe in breathe out now be here now I hope this meditation helps you find Clarity inspiration and maybe helps you find a moment to catch your breath will be back on Friday with the next installment of our Elemental series working with the energy of Elemental fire so until then your magical people be wise be Wicked and keep it with g

welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode we're continuing our Elemental Magic series with the element of air air is the breath the life-giver It's associated with communication with movement with Beginnings with intelligence and so much more and I'm show and I'm going to air sign huh yeah I'm also an air sign cell is a Gemini and Aquarius but we agreed not to say AirHeads support yourself back off that but first before we dive into are I just wanted to talk about real quick something that we mentioned last episode during our Earth episode we want to make sure that we're clear and that is put out there we have a contest and it's called seasons of The Witch how much cooler going to get seriously cuz really we are approaching the sea  open of the witch and pumpkin spice I like to think all seasons are seasons of The Witch but there's one in particular that if you are one of our benefactors benefactors donate monthly to help you the podcast on the air first of all thank you so very much yes you get an entry just for being a benefactor and if you do send us a letter is postmarked between August 8th and October 1st you can get an extra entry we buy the factors can get more than one entry everybody else she'll have some details for you so we're going to give this away to anyone who sends US mail at our PO box which by the way back on the broomstick PO Box 106 Salem Massachusetts 01970 we are giving this  a way to anybody who sent us mail between August 8th and October 1st and this is not restricted to United States residence so no matter what country you send us mail we will enter you in for the drawing to win the contest is for the seasons of The Witch Stalin Oracle this is provided by shell in myself and yes

if you are a benefactor as long as you become a benefactor before October 1st you are also entered into the drawing do I know absolutely will be held October 10th so I just want to add our goal is to have those seasons of The Witch Oracle deck in your hands  prior to Samhain so that you can do us know if you are out of the country I can't guarantee exactly right so we are here to talk about more Elemental energy what are we talking about today show talking about are Layla and you know I find I have such a love-hate such a love-hate with are so I did want to kind of talk about that for a second because I know that sometimes folks have a hard time connecting with a particular element and for being an air sign I feel like I have a hard time connecting with the air element it's just strange to me sometimes I wonder if people have trouble with it because it's invisible it's hard to see and so sometimes I think if that makes it a little more mysterious for people but I'm such a Words which that are has always been kind of easy for me I can't I can't shut up I mean  a podcast because I can't stop talking I'm a communicator that's right I think you're right I just there's nothing like with fire you know you focus on the flame and with water you've got the water there and with Earth you know you're deep into the dirt and was are it's like this invisible gas that you are is it here is it not here I know I'm breathing it but you know okay there you go and that's what I usually tell my students is breathing it really like to bring it back to the breath because that's so fundamental and that's something that we can control and that we can actually feel very easily so bring it back to breath and communication is very important I think when talking about are energy and you know I think that speaking of breath and that is a good focal point when working with are at least for me because it's the one thing that I can kind of quantify  that are with I'm breathing it must be there you know what I'm saying but like the communication you know it's also kind of for me thoughts you know I know sometimes people will cross thoughtfulness between Aaron fire but I kind of look at fire Moore's action and errors the thought you put into it prior to that and subconscious thought not active thought so very deeply thoughtful and communicative element in a correspondence to the element yeah and another way that people can connect with it if communication also means intuition it means talking to your ancestors it means divination so when you're casting rooms when you're pulling tarot cards all of this is very deeply entwined with elemental are your intuition your divination all of these messages coming to you are coming to you very strongly  true are true that element and you know also creativity I think of are as well and I think it's just kind of that when I think of are I have that like a most Whimsical as you so I feel that when I'm thinking of creativity and artistic manner or inspiration in potentially to stick manner I'm thinking that is an air quality yeah air is very much about intellect and creativity it's about learning something new it's it's springtime and we talked before about are being associated with yeast and with the Dawn and even if you don't necessarily associate are with the direction of East are still very often associated with New Beginnings like the freshness of a spring Breeze a breath of fresh air people will talk about the breadth of inspiration or intuition so it's a very deeply connected to those new beginning ideas even if you don't connect it to Dawn and also  each of the elements is associated with different season and Dawn is kind of represented by that spring season that Awakening the dawn of the seasons the winter has pulled back things are starting to grow things are starting to pop up and that is also kind of their heirs aspect of the wheel has definitely communicate and spells communication ritual is communication chanting is communication all of these I associate with the element air to work this into your practice what are some ways that you like to work with are in your brush work is probably the first thing you know not so much now but back in the day chanting as well I don't know how I kind of pulled away a little bit from from chance enchanting but back in the day I would have said chanting as well as yeah but breath  lends itself very easily to a cyclone to a tornado type visualization of energy so if you call are in with the idea that you want to raise it up and do a cone of power and directed to something your brain your magical brain will very easily connect the idea of drawing in are energy whipping it into a cycle a spiral a tornado and then pushing it to your target so if that's a very easy visualization for your brain to hold onto so you can pull are energy in that way towards whatever purpose that you have especially when using a chance and then whip it into that spiral just makes it easier is also easily worked with for me anyway during storms you know when that wind is weapon start going back to what I said before it's almost like because it's a weapon it's Quantified and I can feel it there for but the way  thoughts can travel in the wind the way ideas can travel in the wind I feel that sometimes air is also a courier to the next step to air will carry the wind will carry you on to the next stop so I look at it almost is like a a vehicle of chain is a great way to carry messages to the universe a lot of people talk about burning something tonight I know that's fire but the smoke the idea is the smoke from what you burned carries your message off through the air to the universe the same goes for if you're burning incense the smoke of that incense as an offering goes up through the air so yeah there's a little fire involved but like we mentioned last episode not very much that you'll find in the world is pure one thing or another I had to make sure I pointed this out some some point in the episode in this is a good time so do you know what it one air tool would possibly be  I want okay you are just have to take it there and okay a broomstick Layla a broomstick oh yeah I've always kind of had that be an air tool I don't know very ones like rooms are very well and like and a sweet things away I love it also but when you think of a witch on a broom in the night sky she is using her broom to fly through the air out a room you can actually sweep out the negative energy to clear the air so that works great and of course you know there's different associations and different correspondences obviously like you said feathers I'm always thinking of birds or my favorite dragon  eyes always make me think of air and bees to I Love The Folk practice of whispering to the bees you know telling them messages that they will carry to our beloved Jet and those are all properties of air yep you know as far as magical workings I would say my biggest thing are specific is going to be the breathwork few times and we've talked about meditations of things in the past we've talked about box breathing where you concentrate on your breath a lot of traditions will have you concentrate on the breath because it is part of life it is so vital to life and so by respecting your breath and by paying attention to your breath not only are you honoring the elements of air but you're honoring life itself box breathing is breathing in for a count of for holding your breath for a count of four breathing out for a count of four and then holding your breath again for accounted for and then continuing to do that and that's  one of many different ways that you can pay attention to your breath and really connect with that energy and also use that to raise energy for spell work what do you do to connect with a specific play incense is a big one for me I do love to have incense and nice smelling thing that said give them I also have a lot of plants in my house and the room for a particularly have a lot of plants I feel like the air is nicer there and so sometimes if I'm doing a meditation especially one that involves a lot of breath work I like to work maybe in my living room where I have a ton of plans or in this one corner of my office where I have a nice window in a lot of plants and that really helps me to feel like I'm connecting not just with are but with elemental energy and Jen I like the number to I've never looked at plan Suzanne are things so interesting perspective that I'm going to ponder in the elemental Earth meditation that we posted not too long ago one of the things I do  talked about was breathing in harmony with the trees and even though that was an earth meditation getting you connected to the earth into trees the idea of breathing with a plant is very Air Base because when you breathe out the carbon dioxide you breathe out is what the plant breathe in and the plant breathe out oxygen that you then breathe in so just thinking about that symbiosis that cycle between you and the natural world while you're sitting in your plant corn or whatever that is a beautiful error meditation in a beautiful way to work with the energy I think it's another example of how something such as trees or plants can be under dual elements everything else we talked about in the earth episode where the idea of these building blocks of life came from and we know now there's how many elements on the periodic table  all of our ancestors only thought they were five there's more of them when we were in ninth grade how about that and they literally thought that the only pure things were dirt are that's all around us water and fire they told you those were the only pure things and everything else was made up in some way of all of those things and then powered by Aether are orbs spirit so nothing is really really just one thing or the other yeah so Layla let's let's kind of just jump a little bit too cuz we talked about this with Earth, but I want to make sure we touch on it with each of the elements let's talk about for a second some deities deities associated with are because I know that's again another thing that that people are looking for who do I do I call to when I'm working with are as far as deity and I mean I think the biggest one I can think of is going to be Odin and I think it's because of the whole  storm aspect with Odin and how I view storms a lot of the time is an air thing ends and written language and his companions are two crows so how about you Leila what are who are deities you think of when you think of are well two of the big ones are Mercury and urine urine test because that's my planet that deity is air and Mercury is variares the communication he's the heir God I also feed the dog, and his role as the sky father and father of speech is very are like assholes or as the goddess of the sky and of Art and music can be a goddess because she is goddess of the night sky the stars in space  haraf it's because her domain includes the wind and sky and one of her symbols is a peacock zephyrus he's a Greek god of the West Wind and I remember his name because a zephyr is a type of wind some people also say fairies fairies and two types of fairies called silt are also are fairies that people like to work with and they'll say that they are associated with that element I've also seen people associated with are very much are not just one thing Daddy and ask to work with the aspects of them that are related to your working in this case are but you don't have to work with all of the elements that make them up but you can call on different aspects of them feel like most of them are multifaceted the lightning thing would be a big reason why but  let's just mention the elephant in the room okay ones swords swords ones we all have different views on which direction are is I've you are in the East and I know people view are the north the important part is how you honor the element and not necessarily what quarter the element is in yeah if you know why you picked up quarter for the element automatic yeah that's fine all the matters and Wands now the argument for some people is that stores are are because they cut through the air because they Bayern that's right they also say that swords are represented by are because people talk about a sharp wit or sharp as a tack a keen intellect  so they say that that means it's towards our air Juan's being fire because they burn I haven't seen much other reasoning why ones are that action that fire Elements by be honest with me East are wand type of girl are as communication and to represent Communications expert get passed around if you pick up a Juan because you're a magician or a wizard or witch you're using it to cast a spell you're using it to direct your words your will and I know people like to say that stores our communication but when was the last time someone picked up a sword with the intent to talk right by your reaction sometimes with the consequences of that action and Wands are Barefoot again if you have a different Viewpoint as long as you know why you have that Viewpoint or cool with it that's fine  absolutely so using different tools to represent an element is wonderful and the reason you do that is to help get your brain your subconscious your magical brain in the framework to recognize that element so if you put everything around you that reminds you of are you have wonderful incense going if you have some light music in the bathroom can all represent are maybe you have the color yellow or light pale colors whites and yellow some people like pastel colors anything light in pretty free-flowing curtains anything that makes you think are put that all around you and then sit and have a full little meditation and focus on your breath will post a short are meditation that will go along with this episode as well but I also have a spell with your breath that I could talk about I bet you do all right do you remember when I talked about how to feel and her  by using the soap bubble imagery between we all remember practice today so we're going to give you the similar type thing but this is to learn how to push energy into something to come up with energy that has a certain flavor and push it into something so what you're going to do is hold up your hands palm-up in front of you and concentrate on your palms until you can feel them kind of warm up just a little bit then you're going to put them so they're Palm to Palm in front of you about two to three inches apart just like you did in the sense of energy sounds an awful lot like Reiki to me but it keep going it's very very similar very similar break is all about raising energy flavoring it a certain way and pushing it so this is a lot like that I'm giving away Ricky secret I have no idea I'm not certified you are and I don't know what I'm talking about  apart from each other and instead of a massive little bubbles like I had to Envision before to feel that energy now I want you to think of a time when you had just one big soap bubble between your hands just one big one in between your hands sometimes I actually visualize it as a bubble gum bubble yasso picture of big bubble with a bubble gum soap whatever you want but a nice big one big round bubble between your hands just sitting there nice and strong and beautiful then you're going to think of whatever energy you want pick a spell show something you want to spell for okay how about a spell for Prosperity Prosperity going to be for success and prosperity so you get your mind off thinking boss about success and prosperity and you feel solid in yourself and you're still in visioning this bubble between your hands  now you're pulling into your Center into your belly success Prosperity money doing good feeling happy and secure in your life and you're thinking all these things that mean success and prosperity to you and once you've got that in your belly all big and strong read that in your lungs breathing into your lungs all that energy and mix it up with all those feelings and then blow it gently don't pop the bubble blow that energy into the bubble like you're blowing smoke into it and it should be green for prosperity and success and then just imagine that smoke that green colored smoke swirling around inside that bubble as you blow all that energy into it and then hold it there and imagine that energy swirling Andreas at bubble above your head and pop it on top of your head and Let the Smoke Fall all down around you now you can raise the energy of success and prosperity you've directed it into the bubble and then you put it back into yourself to give yourself that black  you could also push that energy into a crystal or into something metal or something else that so that you can hold on to it for later or if you were going to say you were doing a spell over too well for someone else you could you could direct it into a crystal or another object and give it to the to a person or put it into that bubble and then pop it on them this is really just an exercise for you to practice raising different types of energy into your breath flavor your breath that energy of air that life giving breath flavor that would whatever energy you want to cash in your spell and then blow it literally direct it into that bubble in your hands and your cupped hands into a chalice is McChrystal and then blow that breath that you have flavored with the energy you want for your spell into the item and now you have that ready to direct so that you can push that energy out to the universe to work your will so not only are you working with the element and  doing a ritual with and directed at the element but you're also getting yourself practiced more and you know energy development and energy directing a lot of people have a hard time working with it but it's such an easy way to raise and Direct Energy you just do a little bit of breath work in a meditation you can really feel that energy freezing up I just think it's a it's a nice way nice easy way to get connected that people Overlook sometimes I think that when I was a newbie which I don't know if that's the right term but that's what I'm going to say when I was a newbie which I think that I didn't take enough stock into breathwork because I I took I took breathing for granted there for kind of took breathwork for granted and I don't think it really dawned on me how important doing breathwork was legit until I had two kids  in any kind of learn me like how there's something to this breath thing and you know I think that's what really I think childbirth is what kind of gave in my mind validity to breathwork makes a lot of sense if you can control your breath you can calm yourself down you can hide yourself up you can help control pain I mean there's so much that you can do if you can work with your breath really well you got it meditation know that breath work is a huge part of that so we mentioned chanting earlier as a way to work with are and singing and chanting are a form of breath work listening to music even if you don't sing is another way to connect to the air element and listening to music while channeling because communication writing and words are really good ways to work with are and we talked a little bit about journaling we talked way too much about journaling little more because journaling and getting those thoughts out like you mentioned earlier in the app  oh that thought thinking we also are and sometimes you need to get that out sometimes you just need to do some Journey Pages just get those pages out in the morning just right right right right right right and that can be a really great way to help bring Clarity which is another air quality you can bring that Clarity in that clear missed yourself before you do a working if you're just able to write it all down right all the things that are cluttering your brain and just get it on paper and get it out simple spell in and of itself sometimes communicating could be communicating with your Spirit guides just cuz you write it out doesn't mean you have to give it to anyone in particular you could give those writings to your Spirit guides to read and you know a spirit work working with ancestors and spirit work is all are this is all about its communication if it's digital communication if you're working online the airwaves that's right it's all are this podcast so if you were sitting there  incense going you're listening to our podcast you got a nice warm cup of tea and you're pulling tarot cards to journal air air air air air air air air energy Brushwood 2025 playlist true I do to actually speaking of our Brushwood playlist I do believe that the Brushwood radio used to in the offseason just play random music but I believe now they have recorded shows like ours and they're doing those shows the pre-recorded Brushwood radio spots during the serious rising and and colorful pasta bowls are all going to be played on rotation on Brushwood radio you should put a link up to that I will I believe they're also going to start having talk shows and a few things like that  you might hear a couple of your favorite podcasters pop up down there now and again it was crazy witches as a companion to at this episode as well I did have a little tidbit here about their can assist with past-life regressions and kind of conducting with maybe the past lives that you have had I know that ancestor work is a part of air but sometimes they look at your own ancestry and this is a good time to do past life regression where have I been in other lives I mean I know I know that where I've been in this life where have I been in other lives in this is a good time to kind of tune into that or get with somebody meet with somebody maybe a hypnotherapist or whatnot that can assist you with past-life regressions but I think anything really to do with Spirit very much as an error  whether you're communicating with your past Spirit ancestors Spirit whatever the case maybe it's all are my my fascination with meditation definitely let me down the hypnosis path and I did get certified in hypnotherapy and I'm also certified in past life regression and I have done some very interesting sessions with people doing past lives but I would usually associate hypnosis and past life regression war with water because of its relationship with the subconscious and deep memories so I can see how you'd like it to are as well by seeing spirits and spirit realm is are communicating with your past life could also be seen as are so it's one of those mixture of elements occasion to go together and meditation anyting it with the mind like that is associated with are hypnosis a little bit multi-element  very much thinking it's one of those crossovers are well past life regression is so fascinating and have you ever had have you ever done a past life regression had someone guide me through it in the past on my falling down at once before and I feel like I've told you this before but can we both say we're not shocked that this person told me I had been a princess in a former life I am not shocked at all cuz I surely was not shocked but yeah I was I was actually told that I was a princess in a former life in an area that is currently known as Russia but I would like to download it to this again some other time with you and have you just take me down that path and see where I have been I know I am very surprised I mean I have done past-life regressions for other people in our community before but or whatever we never have and I'm kind of  I will have to see if the Russian princess thing comes up but some of the things that come out from that really helped people you know when I've done past-life regressions with people before it usually has brought up something that is related to issues that they're having in their life right now literally something that they're continuing working on from a past life and they still are working on it in this life lessons and working on lessons you know can be part of that working with are energy and finding things about yourself from past life can often help someone work through blockages or issues they're having in this life that's one of the things that just fascinates me is how often do with the way that they died in their past life or maybe their occupation or something that happened to them in their past life relates to things that are relevant in this life now I'm not saying that everything is related to your past lives because most certainly is not that it's known to happen. It's surprising how often these correlations  and how is talking about it can really help people in this lifetime work through it and again that communication thing you know that's very are like we are humans are kind of like aggression is digging down to the next layer and then to the next layer because all of the people that you have been in the past really do create and make up who you are now and I want to know where have I been in what if I done that is created this hot mess to do ancestor work is to also do deep meditation or hypnosis therapy work with past life regression where you can talk to your ancestors you know maybe it's not you in a past life but maybe you do some hypnotherapy work where you go back and you call your ancestors and you have a conversation with them you know that can be very helpful sometimes for people who have difficulty ancestors I'm a firm believer that once people pass they  become connected with more of their oversoul that they become connected with more of who they have been through many lifetimes and all the lessons that they have learned so very rarely have I encountered someone unless they've just recently passed is still a dick once they've been dead for a little while even if you have problematic ancestors you are more than likely going to be able to connect to the time on some level there less dicks now because Heather I got grounded  terrible but communicate with your ancestors communicate with the spirits and I doing meditation and hypnosis therapy a lot of times I can facilitate that communication that can help you in this lifetime can I just give a left turn sign out here are six sense of humor is why we are the bestest yes that among many other things I absolutely are sick are sick twisted sense of humor definitely does not hurt at all I think maybe probably the best way for folks to just take a step back and honor are and do some working is with air would be to just maybe be cognizant of your of your breath that's probably the best first step I could say is be cognizant of your breath breathe everything how often have you been in a bad mood or been all scattered at someone says take a breath so many times have you told me that and you take that deep breath  answer your nose out to your house and you immediately that calm that relaxation you startled me and just being right there that can help center you and help bring you right back to this moment so breakfast so important so next what are we going to talk about next Layla next week I believe we will be talkin about by here or firefighters everyone's favorite elements I think every other person at brush with no I'm not complaining I think it's awesome but I think like every third person that Brushwood had some version of fire as a name a popular Pagan name to close to Hellfire but yeah a lot of fire names well I guess we're going to dive into fire next time and we're going to see if we get back thank you all so much for listening to this episode of  back on the broomstick please like subscribe leave us some reviews it really helps the show out helps you will find us and make sure Lanai super happy for the love of the lady send us mail people again you will be entered into the seasons of the which saw in Oracle deck drawing if you send us something in the mail postmarked between August 8th and October 1st and again you can find us app back on the broomstick PO Box 106 Salem Mass 01970.

is a simple meditation to help connect you to the energies of the earth I would first recommend that you find a quiet place where you can sit comfortably and you won't be disturbed about 10 minutes if it's possible for things that remind you of the Earth around you maybe it's crystals or Stones maybe it's sticks or maybe it's things in Earth colors with Browns and greens maybe have some plants but whatever it is the most important thing is to be in a place where you're comfortable sit or lie down and feel the floor or the Earth beneath you if you're lucky enough to have your bare feet on the ground sit in the grass or just sit in your favorite chair or lay down and be comfortable  when you're ready close your eyes  take a slow deep breath in through your nose in your belly  exhale gently through your mouth  letting the tension slow down we're rolling away from you and sinking into the Earth down away rolling away into the Earth  again in Hell selling your Valley  exhale releasing letting go  with each breath you are settling more deeply into yourself into the earth into relaxation  relax and noticed your breathing  you're breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide in harmony with the trees with plants in the green life all around you you breathe in and they breathe out  you breathe out and they breathe in  remember imagine or Envision a tree the rustle of leaves the warmth of the sun on branches the scent of bark just breathe and remember the tree  now bring your awareness to your body to the rise and fall of your chest breathing in harmony with a life around you  breathe deep and strong into your chest and down to your belly down your thighs down their legs that are routed to the firmness of what is supporting you down to the earth below and beneath you and down and down  let your body be slow and still and as you breathe you may imagine strong living roots that grow from the base of your spine on the soles of your feet down to the rich dark soil down through Stone reaching deeper deeper into the Earth with each breath  these roots anchor you  they are studying they are patient as you can be steady and patient  Route 8 and strong  Justice you are rooted and strong  perhaps you feel the coolness and the quiet of the soil around your roots  perhaps you noticed a faint hum quiet pulse of Life deep in the center of the Earth are the heartbeat of the mother  enchanting wisdom of the Ancients buried all around you you are held here by the Earth  child and comforted deep and secure with each breath you draw off the energy of the Earth from your roots  strength of stone patience of trees the memory of ancestors who walked before you the power of transformation that turned seed to fruit work to reward  place your hands literally or figuratively Palm up supported on either side of you  bring your attention to your palms  in your mind imagine drawing a circle around the center of your palm  beyond the tingles are the warm subtle pulse of energy gathering in the center of your palm with your next breath in draw the Earth's energy up through your roots early your body the energy of strength of conviction of study power as you exhale direct that energy down your arm to your right hand or right hand grow heavier as the energy of the earth pulls their warmer pulsing alive  and happy hour with each breath  heavier and heavier and warmer willing the power in your palm with each inhalation and exhalation  when you are ready gently close your right hand holding that power in a ball of light  now what's your next inhalation gather again the energy of the earth up from your roots  the energy of Courage of wisdom the power of confidence  exhale and direct that energy down your arm and into your left hand feel imagine or envision your left hand grow heavier with each breath huling that power in the center of your palm  your left hand grows heavier warmer pulsing with energy  when you are ready I was your left hand holding that energy safe and steady  now with each inhalation and exhalation strengthen the energy you hold  let your roots connect even more deeply to the Earth  every breath a cycle of strengthening of deepening of connection  let your roots connect even more deeply to the Earth  let the energy flow through you and powering the glowing energy of your hands  when you are ready Place one hand on your heart and one hand on your belly  feel the warmth of the energy you've raised sink into your skin and muscles into the blood and bones that make up who you are all of you feel the warmth of that energy flows through your whole body until every cell every part of you is live with it  reminding you that you are powerful you are sacred you are enough  whisper gratitude a word of thanks to yourself to your ancestors into the land make it a mantra thank you thank you thank you  Brave  islami bring your awareness back to your body where it rests  are the sounds around you  gently stretch

said we are here for elements we're going to talk about Elemental Magic now we're going to start with Earth and there was some little conversation about this I want to talk a little bit about why we're starting with worth I want the listeners to do with why why Earth is our starting point so for me I like Earth is a starting point it could be from all those chance 30 years ago  earth air fire water it just a good starting point but it's that grounding it's that centering piece that comes with the element of Earth that just seems to naturally be the first the first one for me how about you elements the elements of energy in itself has worked with by pagans and has been considered to be like a building block of magic and of the universe for literally thousands of years so that's why I wanted to start the idea of elements I want to start with it with where the idea of working with elemental energies came from and it's because in a lot of philosophies people thought that the building blocks of life itself or made up of four energy sometimes five fire water Earth and air are the elements that made up everything it was even written about by a philosopher is like Aristotle in Greece it's an Indian Hinduism it's in China a lot of these for  he's talked about the building blocks of life and in ancient Greece they had one of the first examples of the idea that everything is made up of the four elements plus sometime Spirit comes from a Greek philosopher named empedocles in the fifth century BCE and medically is refers to the elements as the for roots and he assigned of each of these routes to a god or goddess he says that Earth was aligned with Hera that are was aligned with the Zeus fire aligned with Adonis and water was probably a line to the goddess nests later Aristotle famous philosopher Aristotle comes in and suggests the Aether is The Fifth Element because the stars and the gods obviously have to be made up of something more special even more precious than the elements that humans are made up of so he had this idea of ether and other place is called that spirit  persol sometimes plasma now when witchcraft had its Big Revival in the 70s it came we came through Wicca and this was created by a lot of people Margaret Marie Gardner Aleister Crowley Doreen Valiente then we've got Raymond Buckland and Alice the Alexander Sanderson Sanders Alexander's Sanders Sanders the Sanderson sisters are the Hocus Pocus people not the people who created which no no no no Stewart Jennifer Laurie Cabot Starhawk Margo Adler Oberon Zell excetera excetera odd nauseam so when we learn witchcraft in the 80s it was still very very heavily influenced by Wicca and Wiccan was influenced by these philosophers and ideas that had come from even earlier that assigned these building blocks of life these four elements plus Spirit to the  East for air South Fire West for water and North first and then in the center would be spirit for deity and that's kind of what we learned in the 80s and 90s and in Wicca you started in the East and the reason for starting in the East was because of the Dawn that's where Beginnings are its are was associated with the elemental East and so communication and that's kind of what you doing going to spell a ritual as communication so when we kind of came up in witchcraft in the 80s and 90s that was the prevailing ideas start in the East because of new beginnings because of the Dawn I do like starting in the East because of that but a lot of the chance that I taught my children was earth air fire water not just because it Rhymes better with daughter but because our family and it's that foundation in the sad faces and I like starting in the North in particular working with energies it's good to start in the north because there's that ground  an element that sound Beach let you know and and people need that you need to have that grounding first so it feels very natural to start there and I didn't struggle because you're right you know those kind of push the start in the East thing and I am I such a non-conformist I couldn't conform to that cuz for me personally it never made sense so long to get along but in my personal practice it always was Earth first I understand what you're saying about the history in the philosophy of it all but when you break away all of that it just comes down to I just feel that  to start working with the other elements I need to be rooted in and to be rooted in you start with her starting in the East because of the Dawn makes perfect sense starting in the north because you need to start from a rooted base makes perfect sense you'd also make an argument to say that you want to start with fire because you want that activation energy you need that spark to start or you can say you want to start in the west because of that movement the subconscious the emotions need to get involved you can make an argument for any of those places to start I would say that most people probably start mostly in the North or the East because of the reasons we said East for new beginnings and are and North because that Foundation being rude definitely no rule book either moisture wicking  but also know your tradition the tradition that you're in right now is Celtic is Celtic based correct in that position they also starred in the north correct someone who starts on the North like me one of the fun things about Celtic Traditions is there one of the few that doesn't really do the five elements there more big i3's Council of things in threes are more about Earth's air water the land that are and the Sea that's what they're big on but they do have fire festivals they have like the big fire festivals and everything so they like to tell you that it's free but there's a fourth one that gets in there the fire all the time so the first thing we should maybe kind of delve into his why would you want to work with us and you know you really want to work with all of the elements but why Delphine to Earth again I go right back to that grounding that feeling of connectedness rootedness feet on the ground there's that big  sing lately about earthing or you no touch grass go outside and touch grass and there's a lot to be said for that because getting your hands in the dirt or getting your feet on the dirt can be very centering it can help you to feel very connected to the Earth to your body and that's what that energy feels like it feels like belonging like feeling strong in your stance and feeling centered and grounded in your place and people will talk about grounding is something that you should do before or after any type of energy work and actually touching the ground can help you do that right there's something that I've been hearing a lot lately called Forest therapy which by the way love the concept the idea is you can disconnect from The Real World hustle and bustle and you just go spend some time in the forest with that literal Earth surrounding you and I've heard that called Forest bathing same thing different you know differ  oops, different things but there is something to be said for that Earth Energy that called I feel like with Earth Energy there comes from ancient call if that makes sense you've got trees and in different things that have been literally alive for hundreds of years and you're just soaking in that energy there is a call than that and I think the reason I always liked starting with Earth as you start with that calm before you then Delvin first gives you that chance to shut away the real world hustle-bustle just like walking into a forest and Ice called forest and it almost has you in that prepared state of mind so then move forward with magical working or whatever the case may be grounding literally gives you a stable place to start from if your mind is too busy if you're busily feeling too drained grounding allows you to come to a center  it allows you to feel a connection to that agent nastu to that great mother that will take the excess energy in your brain and help you to route that down to the ground like talking to your mom and getting all of that stuff out so that you can have a calm clear mind and then if your body is tired it also allows you to pull energy from that Earth mother like getting a hug from your mom it just kind of revitalizes you physically so now you've come to us censors when he colibrium to a stable place where you can do that magic your brain is calm and quiet your body is active and energized but stable you're at you're at a center you're at a nice clean place to start working energy and you also have that connection open so if you need to draw more energy from the earth or be more stable on your feet while you're doing your energy working you have that line that link that connection open to use during your magical working and I think that you know it's it's also good to take note that maybe you are not in an area  you know that has a lot of open space or a forest to go walk in you know maybe you're living in the concrete jungle I have found that you do what you got to do in a pinch and sometimes dirt is dirt you know maybe you have a houseplant and you know you're living in the concrete jungle there's nowhere for you to really connect with nature in your location put your hand in the dirt in your house plant you know what have a moment with your plants and I know it's so weird for me to say but I'm actually starting to form a relationship with these plants I don't laugh at me you know if you don't have the opportunity for your quote-unquote outdoor Earth space you do have an ability to create indoor Earth space through things such as house plants and you don't have to connect with Dirk physically your body is Earth your physical body is a representation of Earth so even if you're just able to clap your hands tap on your thigh  tap your hand on your heart a little bit in a drum beat you are your body is physical Earth and you can connect to that deeper Earth energy through your body you can also do it through other stones or crystals that you have with the idea is to connect yourself to a greater power than you to this idea of stability of center of ancient knowledge of groundedness all the things that you would describe a large body of Earth as that's what this energy feels like it feels heavy it feels slow moving it feels very ancient and thick and protective and solid there's also an element of wisdom to be garnered from that as well so it's not just that feeling of groundedness centeredness that peace and calmness there's also that sense of gaining that ancient wisdom back up from the earth you know you kind of ground out  energy but what you're pulling back in includes some of that ancient wisdom that can only be garnered from the earth that you do and then you can say that about each element and we'll get into that as we go but four specifically you're also not only pulling up back that Earth Energy but you're pulling in some of that that Earth knowledge we've talked before about doctrine of signatures and like-for-like Magic the Earth contains our ancestors come from the earth and we return to the Earth it retains all of that knowledge think of archaeology we go down through the Earth and we learn about our history we learn about other people's and we learn about science and patterns that came before of the earth so knowledge deep knowledge ancestral knowledge is also part of that Earth Energy and if you can visualize yourself tapping into that you can draw that ancient knowledge into you while you're doing your workings as well and I think that that  sometimes a piece that's overlooked with the elements and with Elemental Magic because you know if especially like you said you know you're you're pulling that ancient knowledge up but I used I sometimes look at that as the one element where you can Garner that was dumb because with you know with are the wind blows it away with water it takes that away with the with fire it gets burned away but with it gets compacted into an ancient tomb so to say to hold on to it and Record Keeper of elements and sometimes it's the transformation and I'm going to take this isn't really a right turn it it just kind of a little sideways curve but the way you were talking about the Earth got me thinking of how sometimes people like to dispose of their spells or dispose of their ritual items you know if they've used it in a work or something  has a way to do that and it means something so if you're looking to transform something so say you do a spell to transform a relationship stay with a relative you wanted to be better and you make an eggshell jar and into that eggshell jar you put some seeds of new growth and you put some dirt and fertilizer to Foster change and to Foster growth and to Foster blossoming of Bright New Beginnings they put all these things into your eggshells spell and then you bury it and the reason you would bury that type of spell is because you want transformation the Earth is about keeping records yes but it also is a growth and transformation agent you know you didn't put things into the earth when you want them to change so by burying that type of spell your signaling to the magic that you want transformation growth and change from the spouse so it matches the element some kind of glad that you brought that up so you can work with Earth for that  so that's the way you can dispose of your spell is well by being respectful of the elements and by working with the nature of the element to achieve your spell goals into to think of something that might end up being a listener question okay so you know we're talkin about how you can you can gain some of that wisdom back from the earth pull in the energies of the earth and all of that that ancient wisdom so you got all these which is across the planet who are now disposing of spells and bearing it into the Earth I have a feeling people are going to ask us are you pulling in any energies that you don't want back from all of these disposed of spells into you into wow that's an interesting question I want to say no to me I was going to say I would say no because as much as it is a Record Keeper of sorts it's also the Earth is a cleanser  it's a Transformer so if you are concerned about pulling up those energies and in what residuals might be left over from other folks across the land I say no because I feel like that is cleansed by the Earth itself so any energies you are pulling up from Earth in the spirit of Earth are going to be pure Earth energies the only kavya I would add to that is working with Earth in general like show said absolutely 100% not going to be a problem you'll just be pulling up General Earth Mother Earth Energy if you're working with local land energy that can very much be contaminated based on what's going on in the area so you have to be a little cautious when you say you're tapping into local energies and that land has been polluted or that land has been overworked you're going to feel that energy when you work with it it will feel like it's sad or like it's crying out for help  where to go to a cemetery Layla you know you want to be cognizant of where you're doing this obviously Mother Earth energy is very different from local land spirits and local energy just as you wouldn't want to go to say toxically contaminated land and do such things you also wouldn't go dead ass in the middle of a cemetery are always in the spirit of your working General energy that's always going to be great she's got you no problem you're working with a collective whole the whole system but if you're working with your local land Spirits is going to very much reflect what that land is like and how that land feels I very much recommend hanging out in that space going for hikes walking in your local land definitely a way to connect with it and see how you feel how do you feel physically how do you feel mentally after you've done this walk how does it feel to you  and the more you can tap into that the more you can start to feel the energy surround you of that place and I I like that you say you know Go-Go feel your local energy because there's folks out there that they are just natural healers and maybe there is something that is arrived with your local land that you may be able to assist in healing that Land one of the best ways to connect with Earth energy is to volunteer to clean up a park if you live near a body of water sometimes still have cleanup so organized for the land Near That Water you can volunteer to clean up a hiking area or a trail near your home something like that where you can give back to the land and kind of feel that energy know I don't know if you remember those this was probably I don't know what she is like 25 years ago or so when our local Pig and Community back in Upstate New York remember we did the adopt-a-highway program  our designated stretch of highway which Community chores for several years kind of do an earth honoring was we can if you don't have this in your local area I'll just explain it really quick in New York there's a program called adopt-a-highway in different businesses and organizations and groups can quote unquote adopt a section of Highway and then that is your section to kind of keep clean and keep orderly for a designated amount of time and we would go out once a month and literally walk the sides of the highway with our little garbage Pickers in our garbage bags and we would clean the side of the road I think we have that adopt-a-highway for years doing something like that in your area is an excellent way to make an offering to Earth energy is by healing and cleaning the land locally any time that you  go out and work in your local area it's really great this time of year we just celebrated lughnasadh so working with us energy honoring tall to the goddess of agriculture the goddess to give her life to create agriculture right now there's a lot of farmers markets there's a lot of food around if you're lucky enough to be in one of the places that has access to local food so one of the things that you can do to connect more locally with your land and with the energies around you is to commit to just eating what's local to you like either in your your county or your state in the United States and also to eat only what's in seasoned you know you don't have to do this forever but pick up. Of time like 3 Days 7 Days 21 days if you're really feeling it I think Byron Ballard did it for a whole season where she took an oath to just eat Local Foods just what was local and seasonal in her area and it's not easy to do but it feels great connecting it if feels very healing to connect  Brandon that way if you're able to that's definitely something you can do it it also gives you the opportunity to connect with the Earth without all of the chemicals and yak yak that gets put into Foods it gets you kind of in that more natural space physically and out at serious Rising the festival we were just at not too long ago Rush with the Floor Center they do Elemental rituals for each element all five days they started with air air fire water Earth and spirit and for the Earth Day this year they planted a tree they're starting a whole Grove whole circle of trees and they started by planting the first one this year so obviously working with trees is an easy way to get in touch with Earth Energy and we have a lot of tree meditation that help you with grounding and with connecting service energy and I'll add a short grounding meditation at the end of this episode  plenty of time for planning at least in the United States of America we have a designated birthday and this has nothing to do with religion or spirituality it is a designated national day where we collectively try to come together to do things for the Earth and when you said plan to trade that's what what reminded me of it because there are a lot of opportunities on Earth Day to plant trees to connect with the Earth to do stuff to heal the earth I know here in America it's generally April 20th or thereabouts so if you want to do something for your community on Earth Day you got a few months to plan but I feel like sometimes it's hard for me to connect to certain elements depending on the seasons I do I feel like we're winding down my Earth time and I I like that you you brought up the Harvest Harvest  because I feel like by the time we reach that third Harvest now we just we just had our first harvest we got we got a few minutes but by the time we reach that third Harvest it's almost like putting her to bed for the winter you know what I'm saying especially here in the Northeast absolutely. For like October or March I feel like the Earth energies almost go dormant for me but I think it's just because of the location in the season is the elements where you're at because here in the Northeast the Earth does kind of go to sleep for a few months you can still honor that Earth Energy within yourself by going more within a little bit working internally working inside in your home on Hearth and Home activities cozy things indoors that you wouldn't necessarily do during the summer and that's still connecting with that Earth Energy just in a different way just like it's presenting  self differently and that matches to with say when I was living in California winter looked very very different in the high desert then it looks here in the Northeast it was a nicer time it was a time when I could get out and go hiking more because the sun wasn't trying to kill me so I could get how in touch the door a little bit better walk Barefoot a little more often and then when it did start to get colder that's when you go inside a little bit and start to work inside so follow the seasons where you're at and you can still honor those elements just buy kind of mirroring how they look in your area near the energy in your personal life and you know that that kind of brings me to another really good point I wanted to make is the elements are also Associated more often with Direction we've talked about air and Earth and I want to just briefly touch on the north south east west aspect of this so you know traditional  Earth is North followed by are in the East and so on but there is some folks who say that North is are in East is Earth I can't make sense of my head but I think that your presence in place can kind of dictate how you view that as well like you were saying a few episodes back in California you felt that the directions were a little skewed just based on how things fell due to your place and Russians and the correspondences come from traditional Wicca from Gardner and his co-opting of Western European paganism ideas or whole cloth creating whatever it was based on that land mass Western Europe so traditionally quote from the late 1800s traditionally the quarters are East  South Fire West Water North however where you live should definitely dictate High those elements are pulled so in California I did still follows that traditional directional thing because the water was west of me and it did feel very very good that the water was last or definitely went with that but particularly in California north of me I mean I could say North is Earth there were mountains north of me but there was also a lot of mountains east of me and a big land mass the entire United States stretched out east of where I lived on the coast of California so I could have tried they're doing East as Earth and North as air and it probably would have felt very good as long as I was feeling those elements sometimes when you do things out of habit it feels very strange change that habit but if you can get into the habit of feeling those energies and working with those energies it's a little bit easier because if you feel  East is Earth than the Habit is easier to break one thing I've learned in the last few years of living in Salem Salem Heights have a different view of of that a lot of folks here and not everybody I am not speaking for the masses by any means but I've had conversations with folks and there's a lot of people here North we've got a New Hampshire in the White Mountains totally makes sense South the south is just hot okay cuz we're in the north and it's cold in the South is hot so fire all the way but here they flip flop East and West because here the ocean is 4 ft to the east so here in this place east is giving off more of the what I would call West 5 and we get our weather systems coming from west to east here so more often than not we're getting that wind west to east so a lot of folks here the kind  swap out east and west with East being water and West being are against can't grasp that in my mind mental pathways through have it but also feeling energy and working with the idea of feeling that energy so some of the ways that you can feel our think of times when you really felt in your body like times maybe you overate or times when you just got finished doing some work or running a marathon you really feel all the muscles in your body think of a time when you are really sluggish and tired and moving every one of your bones you could feel that push and pull of your body because you were so tired that's that have these lower kind of energy of the earth think slow moving Boulders thank big rocks kind of sitting there and weathering nature think Mother Earth herself  only slowly changing through Ian you know you've got the spirit of these trees some of these trees especially when you're looking at those redwoods up in the Northwest hundreds of years it's taking these things to just slowly rise from the Earth Earth are slow moving their deep the roots of those trees go deep the roots of a mountain go deep they reach high into the sky they're big they take up space Earth is not dainty Earth is take up space and be here now but it's also that rooted deep below but still present up above yes yes all of that so a lot of these meditations and visualizations that your work with we'll talk about routes because it's it's a very easy visualization to get you connected to the Center of the Earth if you save route to anybody around the world  we all know what you mean if you say you are rooted in the earth that is a phrase that every single person if they've ever seen a plant will know what you mean so it's an easy concept to grasp so all of these medications especially the early ones will have Roots involved in it whether you're sitting on your butt here sitting in a Lotus position and you're talking about chakras your base chakra your Moola dhara chakra is right at the base of your spine when you're seated it's touching the Earth or when you're standing your feet are touching the Earth their Roots themselves they look like roofs themselves these types of medications are able to kind of get you grounded and feeling that earthy centeredness very easily magically Earth corresponds to things like the planet rocks and crystals dirt trees and two concepts like ancestors and time transformation her home family it's centeredness and even money instead  Intero Earth corresponds to Pensacola civic Lee and Pentacles will have a lot of that same Earth flavor the groundedness the family the centeredness so you can use these energies and these ideas in your magic if you need to slow down a little bit if you need to take stock of where you are if you need to be more centered in your life you can use these energies in your now there are some deity is also associated with Earth there are different. He's related to each element they are not pigeon-holed to that by any means but a couple of deities that you might be able to connect with and work with to kind of help you feel that that Earth Energy could include obviously Gaia but there's also the M Care New nose so these are deity energies that can also help you work with these element energies can connect you with these you know what I think of Gaia I think of guy  is a big pregnant woman in that pregnant belly is the earth a beautiful woman with a pregnant belly and you'll see that represented yeah that was created by Oberon Zell and that is a that's a beautiful representation of the Earth goddess and any Earth deity we've talked about talked to a few times because it sees lose Foster mother that created agriculture you have series you have Persephone and her mother's A M I think I care new newest slash green man has that horn stop that kind of makes me feel the Earth and I just got the green man and his face is made out of the leaves of the tree any horns God any of the Gods of the word any goddesses of the earth of the woods or they're all going to have to do with that Earth element as in like you said not everything  no trees are Earth and air I think you could even say that their water some people would even say their fire because there'd be consumed by fire nothing is really purely just one thing I do know Dee Dee is really truly just want to be with one and I love how you said a couple episodes ago that when you're working with herbs or something in particular you don't have to work with every single thing that that herb corresponds to the right now we're talkin about Earth so yes these Beauties correspond to lots of different things but right now we're telling Mother Earth how it relates to Earth yeah how are they is it relates to that particular energy and so when you pick up a crystal don't worry what kind of Crystal it is that Crystal was when I'm thinking I'll follow you know I want to work with Earth let me get a crystal I'm not like okay which one I'm like allright what's close to being Mas agus or nothing  crazy witch of the wood and I will go out and grabbed myself a stone from my driveway or cute little Pebble that caught my eye when I was on a hike does not have to be a pretty Crystal anything that has to do with the earth works all I can think about us last year when we went to Central New York but I remember when we were there last year and I think you and I left with like three pocket polls of acorns falling leaves are falling Branch here there I mean I am the witch that grabs some Fallen branches from the 200-plus old Willow Tree to make us magic wands with Tara Woods which we do this it's okay I also I'm a little more glitzy though sometimes I love my shiny things I really love my  so there is something to be said for swinging by your local metaphysical shop witchcraft shop Stone and Gem Faire whatever the case may be in picking up yourself some nice pretty shiny stones you haven't met a pagan Jeweler you haven't liked yet it's not a lie but it doesn't even have to be jewelry you know like just a chunk of quartz crystal and I just happen to grab it cuz it's closed but quartz crystal is always something that I'm thinking you know you hold that in your hand and you hold it tight and you got that energy just starts flowing through you but I say courts cuz I just grabbed it first but I can also grab you know garnet and feel the same exact way it's not about what type of stone it is because all of these stones are a part of the Earth have come from the earth no matter what their color their shape or what some book online or ticktok or tells you the correspondence  bottom line that came from the earth and if your intention is to work with the Earth Energy of it you're going to get Earth Energy flavored with whatever the energy of that Crystal is and one of my favorite ways to work with crystals is with something called a stoning meditation a woman did this that I meant a million years ago in Salem and then met again at Brushwood so high Kate but she did this great thing with stone she had all these crystals and one of the things that she would do is have me lay down and she placed a crystal on my third I know I would get into a nice quiet ready to meditate space however that works for you and then put a crystal on your third eye and think about it in relationship to the Earth let it feel like it's heavy on your forehead feel the weight of it it was done this before Layla and it's almost like the longer you leave it there the heavier it feels yeah those crystals can start to feel really heavy so pay attention  you do that you know that energy just let any feelings go through you but really feel the weight of it on your third eye let it kind of flow through your whole body feel the Earth or the floor or whatever is underneath you feel that connection because somewhere even if you're in 75th floor of an apartment building the Earth is somewhere beneath you and some of that building is created with parts of the earth and it's connected so you can you can trace it all the way down to Mother Earth so feel that stone as it connects itself back to Mother Earth and then feel that energy as it flows through you then after you've done that for a few minutes take it off your third eye and write it down in your Journal write down everything that you felt how did it make you feel did you feel heavy did you feel light did you feel happy or sad right all those things down and then look up what the crystal is and write down the meaning of that particular Crystal and it's okay if it doesn't match because your idea is to connect to the Earth to connect to the Earth Venus  not necessarily to connect to the specific energy of that crystal that's just kind of a side quest but just let it help you feel or see and then remember that the next time you work with that Crystal because it'll have some of those kind of patients in it we do we have talked a little bit about about crystals but I also want to mention and I'm going to plug a friend of ours we have a friend wonderful wonderful guy from Ravens keep Forge check him out online people he's got a book he's got a website check out Ravens keep Forge Thompson our friend Sam does metal magic and metalworking and I've always felt that I get that same feeling not just from crystals but from Metals as well because again metals are all part of the earth so jewelry I always feel that Earth connection with you know I have I currently have a amethyst ring sterling silver so between  Stone in the middle I feel you get that feeling that your fingers and compassed with that Earth Energy so I just wanted to mention not just crystals alone but metal is well in metal magic is it's a beautiful wonderful thing and it again we've got a great friend who is a metal magic wizard and you should check him out because it's not just  maybe you don't have crystals you know maybe you can't get to a crystal store or for whatever reason in your life you know it's it it it could be dangerous for you to have any sort of quote on quote witchcraft supplies around you everybody can wear a ring without judgment and you're still getting that Earth energy from that metal I'm not a good thing I like about metal that matches with Earth Magic is that the Earth holds onto things the Earth doesn't tend to give things up easily and his brother keeper of metal metal does not let go of things easily so if you want to set a spell setting it into the Earth setting it into metal is going to hold on to that spell it's going to remember it much longer than say a candle or writing it on a bay leaf those things are much more easily lost think of a plaque that's written and metal as opposed to a plaque that's carved in wood the metal one  going to last much longer through much more adverse conditions than the would would well could be disposable is less apt to be disposed of so that's going to make your spell your energy last much longer so Earth moves slowly it hold on to things and so does metal so that it is a beautiful representation of that and it can help you hold those energies if you need if you need are thinner G you can push into that metal things but it already knows like staying true staying true to the shape that it was created in staying steadfast strong you can enhance the things that it has to help you in the future so whenever you touch that ring you remember to stay strong to hold fast whatever energies you put in there and you mentioned to ring you no say there's a stone in it like I ain't like I mentioned I have this amethyst ring you can come by and the Earth energies of the Moon and the Earth Energy Service  with maybe some of the other correspondence is of that stone so you know maybe you wanted Tigers I rang to get the other aspects of the tiger's eye stone with a metal together or you know like I have the amethyst and again different Metals maybe you're using gold with a garnet you know so it's almost like I used to do this with herbs to your kind of piecing together which correspondences you're going to use from each ingredient to then create your spell and again like you said before you're not going to be using you're not pulling on every intention from every ingredient you're going to say okay you know so I know that I can use Bay for protection and I'm going to use you know basil for the protection obviously these two things have altitudes of other uses for your focus  is around you that match your intent so if your intent is to connect with this Earth Energy and you're talkin about Care New know she's talking about Demeter you got your plants that you're repotting right there next to you you got to a stick and a stone from your yard you've got a a ring that you really love that helps to make you feel, or whenever you touch it you're putting things around you that remind you of Earth that fit bring forward that energy so when you bring in your tools like you said with the bay you want it for for protection so you've already got your mind set towards protection and now you're bringing in the bay just asked if I want you to continue this feeling of protection in this idea protection and it will lend that particular energy more strongly so you don't have to focus on all right right I love that so you can connect with us very easily very simply walked Barefoot she'll likes to pick on me for walking barefoot all the time but it's a fantastic way to connect with the Earth you can do  meditations will include a meditation at the end of this episode that you can use to help get connected to Earth do a tarot reading and just pull out cards that make you think of Earth as a whole bunch of Pentacles Paul maybe the empress that makes you think of the Earth or the world just told cars and just focus on those while you do meditation spend to get you into that earthy mind it if you are able to visualize if you have that ability just sit and kind of visualize yourself being that tree informing those routes into the ground and dig and deep your route into the Earth because you don't have to be touching the Earth you know like you said you could be on your 75th floor high-rise apartment and you can still visualize yourself burying your own routes into that are connected with that deep-seated energies so if you are able to visualize and meditate that's also a great way to just tap into the  if you can't go Forest bathe or walk barefoot in a field or whatever the case maybe even if it's in the concrete jungle or just go for a walk somewhere that is an excellent way to connect with that earth-type energy don't go fast go nice and slow feel the Earth feel each step walk with intention I love that and if you do have a labyrinth nearby that you can walk Walking The Labyrinth is a phenomenal way to feel that Earth Energy and to walk with intention to a walking meditation and at the central New York Pagan Pride day coming up here in September up in Syracuse New York shell and I will both be doing presentations and one of the presentation so I'll be doing is to teach you how to draw a labyrinth whether you. I'm paper and do with your fingers or Draw and chalk or in cornmeal to do in your backyard so that anytime you need that type of walking meditation connection you'll know how to do that and I'll be kind of doing  Earth Splash are saved Workshop I will be doing a workshop at Central New York take him Friday I'll be mixing some herb energies with some tarot energies and herbs are very earthy and my mind until the point of burning everything else but harvesting herbs that shell and I have been doing a lot of this lughnasadh season this first harvest season we've been Gathering me herbs both planted and wild and drying them you know that's a little air and about to be fire once we burn them but it's very earthy Harvest and just doing that Harvest feels so good you know she'll you mentioned doing you pick and I just found a U-Pick blueberry place near me so I'm definitely going to be doing some of that there's just so many good things now one last thing before we kind of clothes off creating Community is also a wonderful way  to celebrate Earth and that Earth Energy do Layla talk to us about creating Community because you know we've said in the past how it took my sweet wonderful witch in another state to find me my beautiful cousin here in Salem that I love these guys so much it is finally finally become your turn, turn it yet again it seems like I am in a position where there is no groups around me to get to any type of pain cuz I have to drive to h plus can you be the only two hour radius I do not buy that bullshit for a hot second I don't buy that bullshit for a hot second either which is why I managed to hook up with a lovely person in my area I'm going to say her name Shannon hi Shannon you're going to run to whether you like it or not just giving you the heads-up so much alike it's not even funny so but Shannon and I are starting the Crystal City Pagan group Crystal City Circle I think that's going to be the name where we  have a monthly meet up meet and greet classes workshops will be doing Sabbath and S B and our first one will be later this month in August so that's going to be happening in Corning New York and I am very very excited Shannon's amazing all the people that we've reached out to have been amazing so I think this is going to be the start of a fantastic community so if you can find a community near you mandragora magical is a great resource for that go to your local you you your local metaphysical shop or if you're you know like me maybe start your own but communities a great way to celebrate their Central New York or North East Pennsylvania and you are in the Elmira Corning Regional please reach out to Layla cuz she's trying to form this group and she needs some witches around her cuz I feel guilty that I'm such a lovely group of Windows around me now and you need a level but that doesn't negate that we're still The O'Jays man and I do love your car I have not met them in person yet but  you love them all and I can't wait till we all hang out it's going to be my best friend so you're harvest season thank you so much for listening to us talk about Earth and Earth energies and next week we'll be doing our next element which is are because I'm an air-side I am also an air sign so yes it's going to be all about us we're going to celebrate our Ernest that a thing anyway are headed this wispy nature our wisdom house that and her wisdom a communication abilities that's what we talkin all things are shell and Layla so part two are be there or be are and in the meantime stay wise stay Wicked and keep it with you folks

welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick and happy lughnasadh to all of our listeners in the Northern Hemisphere and happy in both to our listeners in the southern hemisphere I'm Layla and today we talkin about the history and ways to celebrate the first Harvest Festival of the wheel of the year lughnasadh and I'm show and I am not prepared for it to be August 1st rest if you know definitely not especially since we just got back from wonderful Festival I'm not ready to let go of that or the summer yet everybody is so sad to come back to mundania and I think I even mentioned to you that I'm very sad that I don't have fire circles and drum circles at night anymore I need more of those in my life but on the flip side of that I am glad to be back for my coven ritual so there's something to be said for that wild and  free Festival environment and then there's something to be said to coming back to a little bit of structure and as I pointed out to you in a text message the day you came home there's a bad yeah yeah that's actually true and I'm quite excited because on lughnasadh on the day that this episode comes out I'm coming back to starting to create a local community in which I am very very excited about I met someone right before we left for festival and so we're having a little get-together on the 1st and I'm very excited to see what kind of local community we can create a super excited for you and by the way I am also proud of you for like putting yourself out there because it's one thing to be a part of a community or Covington or group it's another thing to try to start one so kudos to you  it's hard it's hard so if we have any listeners that are either in North East PA or South Central New York keep on the lookout cuz Layla was trying to start some shit yeah and you don't honestly August 1st is a good time for that I really do think to get us back to at lughnasa  did we get back to that it's a good time to kind of reevaluate your kind of look at where you're at I think we kind of both did that coming back from Festival re-evaluating where we're at in our witchy magical lives and where we want to go from here to call it like mid-year reflection but there's going to be that person who's going to send us a message and say shut up and you're talking August 1st like I hear you but summer is like it's like a mystical and it's like Avalon you know it's like between its between the world and so summer is kind of hazy and so I look at this is like a mid-year reflection it's the first time you're starting to reap what you've sown throughout the year you know it's that first okay this is what I put into it what am I getting back is the first of three Harvest festivals on the wheel of the year of the modern Pagan celebrations what is also a very old Festival  this is one that has been celebrated for a very long time it's a Gaelic seasonal Festival is celebrated in Ireland Scotland and the Isle of Man it typically falls on August 1st but you would calculate it is about the Midway Point like you said half way it's about the Midway point from the summer solstice to the Autumn Equinox this is a good time to make those Reflections that first that Midway Point not only is it kind of that that Midway point but it's one of the considered one of the four Celtic fire festivals other three correct and when I think of the unfortunately when I think of the four Celtic fire festivals it's like the seasons shift to the next turn of the Season it technically this is how I look at it in my mind  the fall but in my mind obviously we're not moving on to follow we still got another month or so of Summer left but technically I'm paper we're shifting to the next season of things I love about this season and you mentioned that it was kind of an in-between time like a liminal space and I really feel that because it's hot it's summer everything is green and gold a little bit gold to Android auto setup Festival season had a part of the liminal feel a little bit  but you know I get home and there's some flowers growing on my front patio because my husband is obsessed with birds and toss us out sunflower seeds and a whole bunch of them germinate and grow a little tiny sunflowers all in my front yard I love it actually unexpected bonus and across from me is Fields tons and tons of fields and farms and I watch them as they cut down the hay and roll it into the big huge fail so I'm seeing firsthand this type of you know Seasons Gaelic Scottish type of weather I guess the cutting down of the grain the change of the season but it still feels hot it still feels like summer but the Green Man John Barleycorn has gone from the bright young man who took off to the woods into the hidden spots in the fields with the goddess in the spring and early  he's older now he's hair is Gray he's gone from Green's gold he's kind of getting Bolder now even the days are getting shorter half the dark half but you know it's also a time to kinda you know you give that quote on quote mid-year reflection it also gives you a time to be thankful for what you have reaped out of what you're selling do you know you did that whole be a little bit too. But where do I go from here I got you know x amount of time left till the end of the year whether you look at the end of the year of Stalin or the calendar end of the year in December what's left what it would have to shift how do I have to readjust and that can be in any aspect of your life and in your job and your spirituality whatever the case may be where do I have to shift to get to where I am  acted to be from a year-long plan this is the first of three Harvest is in the final Harvest everything still abundant depending on where you are you can still grow things for a late summer crops you can start to grow things for a fall crop so taking that metaphorically in that whole doctrine of signatures like-for-like magic in your life that matches this is the time to see where you're at just like you said with all the seeds but you still have time to change it if you need to so that's why it's a perfect time to take stock because if you need to plant new seeds or go in a slightly different direction now is the perfect time to do it or just lay out in the sun and have a good day lughnasadh is a great time to look within and initiate some self-care and I'm going to related to the story of the start of this Festival as long as you don't  nope not a journal to be had here until later in the episode believer in this story one of the things about lughnasa is it's named after the god Lou is the first part and NASA basically means assembly or gathering so it's the Gathering of Lou what is a festival that he started for his foster mother tall to the goddess tall to she was a queen of the firbolg and she was an Earth goddess very powerful very strong and she looked around the land and she saw that it was wild and it was unpaid and she knew that people would need it to be more orderly and to give them food so she gathered herself is Earth Mother this Great Goddess and she went through the entire land and she cleared it and prepared it and created agriculture so that the people could grow food but she used up all of her energy all of her power and might on this great task  I feel that by the way you're right you know she just didn't stop she saw what needed to be done and day and night until the job was completed she did it and then she laid down to rest and died and so that kind of follows along with the god of the grain only in this case has the goddess who created the agriculture you do all this great work and then there's a sacrifice right you know you grow the screen and then you cut it down and sacrifice it to create bread she created Agriculture and sacrificed herself in the process so even though this Festival this this day is about work and sacrifice it's also lose chance to honor his mother through games and crafts and he decided he wasn't going to mourn his foster mother he was going to celebrate her and do all these wonderful things to celebrate her so what I'm saying is instead of like tall to giving all of yourself and then dying only to be celebrated after your death let's  take this opportunity to take stock of where we're at to re-evaluate and who celebrates Paul to she should be around to celebrate herself to to celebrate that hard work that she did why do I feel this yeah you know I think we all do we all have times in our life we have given so much of ourselves and sometimes it can be hard to stop whether you've given enough and you need to take a rest now before you get more or like you said you've given enough and you realize that this isn't working and you need to take that break you need to give yourself that space and be like hey I'm so proud of the work I've done now let's see if it's still what I need if I'm still going in the right direction it'll give yourself that space and that Grace magically in your life do that for you some of the goals used  we are in this is the reason you want to re-evaluate some of the girls who said at the beginning of the year so a good time to re-evaluate where you are isn't for any other reason than you've checked enough of your boxes are you either need to add new boxes or figure out what station without overextending yourself and sometimes you need to take a step back from her project sometimes I'm doing work or you know working on a workshop where I'm working on one of our next episodes I like to give it time and I'll come to a point where I feel like I'm stuck away from it for a minute and give it a little time to rest give myself time to rest and to think about other things do other things and then I can come back to it fresh with new I respect of not only have you rewarded yourself for a job well done you stopped before you spent yourself too far and you've given your  space kind of reevaluate if you need to go to honor the sun wherever where at in the world and honor ourselves and honor the work that we've done so far this year has magic in the most simple things and it's a busy time of year you know it's Festival season in there still such a thing as a side jobs this is generally the one holiday where it's just about being out in the sun no frills I don't always have time for the extras no yes I've done the baking bread thing and all of that but sometimes I just have time to just sit and seal the Sun for what could be I don't want to say like one last time cuz it's not one last time  just as your plants and stuff need need that sun in that energy to grow for you to harvest you need that sun energy to grow out and sit in it or maybe you're like first initial Kar listener from East Texas and the sun is not super happy with you being superhuman it it's super hot it's very strong you can still go out early morning or late evening and watch the sunset or go out in midday just for a second and feel with that sun is like honor the strength of it like me with my sunflowers my my unexpected bonus sunflowers in my front yard go to a farmers market if you can or just as you're driving by some flowers on the side of the road admire them a little bit you know just take a moment to take a breath and it just appreciate where you're at in your life and appreciate where the Suns at where you live however it shows up there and there's also at least around here in the Northeast there's a lot of  local pharmacies that will let you do the you pick I think that's more gratifying you know obviously if I'm having a lower energy day I'm just going to go buy it from from the farmers market but that you pick gives you that sense of I am the one harvesting it and you know me zero greens, which by the way plants are doing fabulous whether it be do you pick wildflowers could you pick fruits and vegetables in a moment to give thanks for what you have give thanks for what you're still working towards if you were to break Thanksgiving up into a season I look at this is like Thanksgiving send like now until November you know thanks Thanksgiving to me it is it is you know you are harvesting and thankful for  what did this didn't work out this year so it works out next time it's a time to kind of be thankful for all the things that are falling into place the season I love that you said it's Thanksgiving see because August 1st is this like Thanksgiving light to me and then Babin's like fall on Thanksgiving celebration but faced Holiday City and I fucking love food so much on Thanksgiving is like my gym  Ryder baking bread going to a farmers market if I can just eating and knowing that somewhere along the line you keep some berries you can taste the sunlight in them practically even if you're eating like some fresh Berry ice cream that's still a taste of Summer and it taste of that sunlight and especially eating a meal with friends or meal with family it doesn't have to be like a full-on Thanksgiving me I'll just having an intentional meal even a small snacks with friends is a beautiful way to celebrate lughnasadh particularly if there's bread involved in the Northeast August tends to be I don't know if it's a weird thing that I just noticed but the moon seems super huge August probably the tilts towards the Earth than and all of that scientific stuff that is a lot of math for me but the moon always seems huge in August and that's always been something that his his kind of captured my attention about August  in general but that you're starting to do the 1st Harvest and then you've got this huge huge Moon August it really is it's that it still feels like summer but you have the first hints of cool nights it's a great time to have fires at night to celebrate the light and the sun in the growing season X the fyre festival can you do the other thing I love about this is much like imbolc which the southern hemisphere is celebrating right now this fire Festival also celebrates water you'll often find people will leave offerings this is a great time to celebrate your land spirits to celebrate animistic nature of all things you do leave offerings of fruits vegetables maybe a little bit of bread it doesn't have to be a lot just a little bit out by a tree or by a river or buy a pond something natural something that's biodegrade  it's not going to hurt the land obviously you want to give good things as offering but offerings by water you know you don't have to build a bonfire if you can have a little candle in your house or even if you can't get in by water for this fire Festival oddly enough is another good way to celebrate lughnasadh holy Wells holy streams were very popular this time of year  grab onto your broomstick witches back after these messages  Cosmic Music Volume 1 your voice Mercury Stern tuna Probz poetic rituals and Mercury's magic you'll reconnect with the truth that's been waiting to ride with an you download now and panties and pros.com begin the journey back to your voice  it's also you know I like getting a thing of flowers the yellow the yellow the the red candles you know just it's almost like you're flirting with so that's the best way to describe that you're flirting with prayers pop with a little chant or read a poem outside to Nature's with a great time like I said to give offerings to the land Spirits into the natural world around you you can journal on abundance you couldn't you couldn't just stop yourself could you I couldn't was very thankful for all too and so he had all these celebrations you can write all the things that you're thankful for and gratitude rituals sometimes it's nice to just take a moment and just striking a lot I appreciate  every segment his good bad or indifferent happened because the bad and indifferent or for a reason and has fabulous when you have a little bit of bread with whatever meal you're eating before you take that bite of bread think about the sacrifices you've made think about the work that you've done think about the things that you're proud of and what you're grateful for before you eat the bread because bread itself is part of this holiday it is a symbol of the growing grain that then gets cut down you know the growing God's then dies and gives himself and sacrifice to us to create that bread so that you can have that and so it encompasses the whole meaning I guess the whole purpose of the season so you know maybe you just want to take a minute before you take a bite of bread and just think of all the things that you have done all the sacrifices that you have made for the Year big incense time for me you know I've been  a crazed Maniac with making loosen sense forever and you are at a point now where you can Harvest those things like I have so much meant right now I lack such a green thumb I feel like someone should have told me that that stuff grows like wildfire like I feel like I needed that warning but anyway so you know if it's going to it's going to Basil's going I have more staged I don't want to say I tried to kill the same age but for lack of a better phrase I think I tried to kill it and it won't die so now it's generally a time and then starting to you know use the old mortar and pestle trying to get my herbal mixes go in my incense my loosen send splendas going because I do like to get them cut fresh get him right dried-out get it made get them sealed up so it's also kind of  timer fiorelli it's time you start canning things so anything that you do like that honors Lewis on my going to take a picture for social media because I love how it looks so much I have mugwort in bundles and leaves I have Mullen and lavender was just thinking of that and meant catnip is also a minute but all these things drying in my office and I absolutely love it I have something bundle for my have some beers just hanging everywhere and it's just perfect and I do think about Lou because you know these through outside the girl in the Sun and he is all about crafts and craftsmanship and you know I'm a maker you're a maker we like making things and sends all sorts of stuff  what is standing there you know I got this look at this little Sage bundle you're going to die laughing by dry it out I do what I do with it and then I slipped through this and it didn't die so philosophical and I'm just like holyshit lives long enough for me to do what I wanted to do with it you know I'm more just like super happy cuz I like how it looks all hanging drying in my office that and quick tip speaking of trying and your office I have not yet gotten a dehumidifier like a dryer they called that like a you know that machine you can dry herbs and stuff to hydrate hydrator I have not got in a food dehydrator pounds to super fast drying my nerves check this out so I have you know like a cooling rack that you have for cookies it's like a mesh screen like take that and I lay out  all my herbs in single file all nice on that and then I put it on the dashboard of my car interested interesting and I leave it there for hours I did it with dandelions in the spring I've done it with Mullen I've done it with mug war is fantastic it works so good they drive perfectly every time so funny story cuz you never told me this so me and my sweet love we're out and about and I clip a couple of these wild roses and I dried them out on the dashboard of my car and after a few days my sweet darling says are you leaving those there and I was like you know  he probably smelled good every time you open the car door to that's what I thought but you know we are underneath and on top and just single layer on there so we have those cooling racks in the dashboard of your car nice hot day for birthday July definitely out of day you're not driving around or you know I've heard that thing where people you go to work and you put cookies on the cookie sheet on the dashboard of your car and you just leave it there while you go into work and when you come out of work you have fresh baked cookies could do that with your arms right put them up on the dashboard when you go into work and you leave your car parked and then when you come out you have nice dry herbs and your car smells like lavender Sun bakes cookies on your dashboard  I'm not going to attest to whether that works great or not cuz you need a nice hot day but herbs however most hot days will be more than plenty to try your herbs out no need for a food dehydrator perfect I like I do too but I did have a little trouble last year I found blue Asters and bee balm that I harvested yeah and I I didn't drive him well I didn't know. I didn't know the dashboard trick last year and I still didn't have a food dehydrator so I didn't drive him well enough I thought I had left them out long enough to dry but after I charged them Unfortunately they are enough before I have to have them super dry or you get mold off until they're super dry but the very first thing I dried that way was dandelion heads this spring and those are  did you see you know there's a lot of moisture in a dandelion flower and they dried out beautifully I've had them Jarred up since the spring not a hint of moles they're perfect sure where the chamomile for this year it was almost like you know how the little I don't know what the heck it's called but the thing in the center that took a long time to dry out that is our crappy thing that we've been doing a lot of lately because there's so much abundance out there everything is growing and popping and trying to get flowers and if you got meant it's everywhere because that's what time of year is this is the first harvest everything is abundance our old Community would bring their first fruits communities right now that we gather with are doing Feast just because Thursday night at the bar at one of the bonfires that we did was about three 4 in the morning and they brought out of Taco feasts and everybody had a taco feasts at The Roundhouse because I love tacos  oh yeah taco feast at The Roundhouse yes please do that again let's do that every night feasting with friends is a fabulous way to share in that abundance and she kind of bring that into your life especially if you can involve games so you and your love to come over we'll have some food will have some bread and look at an all-night and that'll honor Loop, some tacos. Oh yeah we can do tacos I love me some good tacos Then I'm game go to your local farmers market try a new skill try something new hey if you haven't dried herbs before try make your own insensitive maybe that could be a skill that you tackle in honor of Lou and Tall to this year no Layla before we go before we let the fine people get on with her days and nights I would be remiss if I did not bring this up and I did not mention this to priors this going to be a total shock to you too but I feel like I just want to take a moment  to say to all the Gen X folks out there to all of the music lovers across the world we feel you with the passing of Ozzy I've cried I laughed I reminisced about my childhood I just I just wanted to say alright pyasi funny son of a bitch with some good songs he was sad news when generally don't take time out for that type of thing but we did for the Queen We Are For The Prince of Darkness so alrighty I'll see the episode hopefully you'll get out there have a little bit of feast play some games maybe learn a new skill try some crafting the honor Lou and take care of yourself don't burn yourself out do the work but take a break before you give to  like talk to wear modern pagans witches and magical people here we do not need to give all of ourselves to the point of sacrifice take care of yourself do the work but do the self care as well and be grateful for the work you've done appreciate the work you've done and pat yourself on the back and re-evaluate see what you need to do what you need to change but you need to alter and get a move on with the rest of the year check on where those seeds you planted it in bulk are see if you need to replant see if you need to give him something a little boost but yeah this is the time to re-evaluate see where you're at you still have time there still time before the end of the year to make changes on your make new goals and to move forward with that we have some super excited plan for the next couple of episodes guys we are going to do an episode series  we're going to do a five-part series on the elements we're going to go with elemental energy starting with r or Earth and then I said Earth you said are will discuss and we'll discuss what we're going to talk about earth air fire water and spirit maybe not necessarily in that order  so we will talk about all of those different types of energies how you can use those energies in your magic practiced we're not going WIC in here this is more a month or Elemental Magic face show magic face so don't you worry we're not going to go down any strange that we're going to try to go through all those different correspondences and how you can use those energies in your purpose so stay grateful and keep it Richie

and I are going to give you an update from the Brushwood folklore Center and happy Festival moon today I Michelle and I'm Layla and I am really happy to be at the festival I mean it it's hot but we're still having a really good time and she'll and I did some amazing workshops here we're going to talk about that we're going to talk about everything that's going on here and had to give you a little bit of a preview of what festival life is like with tell us for a minute where is Brushwood folklore Center Brushwood is wonderful it was 110 acres I believe of gorgeous face is in Sherman New York which is way on the western edge of the state right near Lake Erie literally on the New York State  a lot of Rochester Buffalo and Syracuse represented so hey we do there's still some listeners here so high guys hi Julie and I mean it's just amazing tonight is the earth ritual during serious Rising everyday represents a different element starting with Monday with air Tuesday is fire Wednesday water Thursday is Earth and then Friday is Spirit Saturday is the combination with the big huge tree story tall on fire do you get a radio show  and we did okay so Brushwood radio 90.3 FM has been going for quite a long time and it has morphed now from just a local radio station that you can pick up if you're on site to they have it online this year's the first year that they're recording the show so that they can replay them online throughout the year I've been doing radio shows for a little while now and she'll and I got to do one this year this is my first time do you want me to tell you that you are so good at that soundboard by the way Frank gives me a little bit of help every year but yeah I'm starting to pick it up it's a lot of fun so shout out to Frank from Brushwood thank you so much for letting me have my first DJ experience but unfortunately is some of our listeners who tuned in know I had a workshop halfway through our radio show ya scheduling was not the best it happened sometime so I stayed behind and continue the playlist that we collaborated on which I have posted  couple places I think I put it on Reddit and we will be putting up on some of the other socials as well if you want to listen but yeah you had to duck out for a workshop what was your first Workshop so my first Workshop I did what was herbal Turtleman say so this was a a fun little thing that you and I fell across literally a year or two back to space space where we mix herb throwing with terros so it was a great Workshop it was nice it was a great day a lot of people had mind-blowing experiences which I always loved but then I missed the second half of the radio show shop so talk to me about your Workshop was on charm casting with everyday objects and we've done is show before and I linked it in the in the show notes about charm casting this is basically the same premise and we went into the his  if I'm passing and what different charms mean and how to do a layout but this was specifically about random objects asking a question and grabbing a few random objects the call to you in the moment to then cast for your meeting so it's just a Twist on the classic herbs to integrate into a little more pre-planning involved but I think the most fun part of your Workshop was the things that people were picking on the Fly for doing their charm casting someone was picking Plantation leaves someone brought a harmonica I mean it was just interesting the things that people were using his charms yeah I really love him some people use their jewelry at there was one I did the workshop a second time and there was one person hear their name is Gage and they wanted a few extra charm so they're try  chipolo ring off and the rain just was stuck and didn't seem to want to come off and gauge says 0 g maybe this rain doesn't want to be in the rating and I kind of laughed and moved on to help some other people and I came back and Gage had thrown the charms down including the rings that they've had trouble getting off but that ring landed so far outside of the board I want to participate yeah we were like yeah I really told you in the beginning you knew it didn't want to participate and you tried it anyway and it said it again and I don't want to be in the street so it was a lot of fun we had a great time inch worm participate in my workshop we did a reading we through the Arabs and an interpreted the herbal meanings based on the cards they landed on in such and then a little inchworm wanted to participate so we we had a little fun with which cards The Inchworm was going to and kind of put a little bit of twist into our reading as far as that way you know what does it mean  The Inchworm went to the sky on this card so it was a lot of fun I like doing outdoor stuff because little weird twist get added that you don't really expect that's one of the joys of brush when is you are mostly Outdoors again I think it's like a hundred and ten acres and had to check their website Brushwood.com to be sure but there are buildings there's a lot of feelings or like the pool house there's the North Pavilion there's a stage in those cabins that you can rent but a lot of it is open and so you get a variety of covered areas where you can have workshops or like she'll your your workshops were over in What's called the East Shire which is a nice big field it's over it has summer seasonal campers and some rental cabins do my workshops is called the storytellers Pavilion and that is right near the radio station and it's some it's more of a like a picnic Pavilion like a picnic Pavilion basically like the cover the tents that you use  show me like permanent made out of wood it's a nice spot this one has electric so you know I tend to do my notes on my laptop so it's nice that I can plug it in if I need to show is fabulously known for note card that's right index cards I love them and I make slideshows but I do also write it in my yeah it's true but I do love journaling especially here doing my schedule is everyday and Terrell journaling about all of it there's just so much stuff and I absolutely adore looking back through old journal entries from you know a year ago or two years ago or five years ago from when I was here and kind of looking at all of it again in and seeing what things kind of changed or don't change or don't change like The Roundhouse in the drumming which is absolutely fabulous every single night  tell me is there a ritual to each element but after the ritual they go to let me backup every element has their own space at Brushwood and they have their own small fire Circle they are dedicated to that elements do each ritual has held there but then there's the roundhouse which is the oldest sight of all of them and it is also the biggest and that's where the drumming happens and the main fire every night whether it's fire ritual or not and fire tribe of Brushwood is is part of the fire safety fire building they're not just the elemental tribe they also take care of everything fire-related fire Spinners at the Brushwood exactly yes they are and somehow as soon as you become part of fire tribe you get sexy and hot as hell I'm not  yeah I don't know if I'm qualified but I'll work on that will develop we would but it's a lot of work in the hot sun like they're slinging chainsaws and big huge trees and log building these fires are everything I've ever seen in my life so with great hotness comes great responsibility is that just the way the world but after each ritual no matter what element is everybody goes back to the fire Circle and there's a big bonfire there there's tons of drumming and dancing and there's what's called first shift second shift and 3rd Shift so first shift is in the morning or morning first shift is about 10 at night right after Sunset and that's the fire-lighting a thoroughly Birds early bird that the family is the kids everybody's just a little drama and everything's nice then there's usually a lot right around midnight and outcomes second shift this is  rum and gets faster the dancing gets Wilder The Outfits get more amazing and you know there's usually some adult beverages and things going around maybe I might have a kid now never know they should all be in bed by now curfew thank you then comes third shift right around 3 a.m. or so and third shift will go to Don and you fall asleep every night if you go to sleep to drumming a fresh Whip and it's an idealist you know there's nothing like that first night I went out at like I don't even know what time I woke up I had to have a cigarette you know how it goes was like 4:30 in the morning and I'm like there's still drama the drumming time is third shift is really going they just gone wild on those drums and it does not slow down at all  and I mean I know we've done an episode or two or maybe three and talked about festivals in the past but you know I do want to reiterate from those episodes there's something to be said for attend at least once in your life go somewhere you do get with a group of like-minded folks especially if that's not what you normally are able to do you know and yes these opportunities are more plentiful in the summer but maybe think about going to a festival next summer or or getting out and doing something with a grander community get out of your shell and go meet other like-minded folks it's fine you know it's worthwhile and I know people live in areas where they don't exactly have these opportunities and I will put a link to a mandragora Magicka which is kind of a new which box and that has links to all sorts of places but it's not complete I had to add serious rising and Sankofa for Brushwood to that and they've been going for  ever so if you know of something in your area put it on mandragora Magica but definitely check there if you're looking for events or groups in your area plus the other wonderful things about Festival is meeting people meeting people that have all sorts of different ideas and Views and things to teach the workshops here are fantastic they are and it gives you an opportunity to maybe get a little bit of a taste a little bit of flavor of something that maybe you weren't exposed to previously or something that you never even heard of before so things like festivals like this really do give you an opportunity to come to expand your practice because you gain different knowledge and experiences it surprised me a couple years ago how many people from Rochester where I was living at the time came here you didn't know any of them when you lived there which I was trying to find them and I couldn't find them anywhere Rochester I had to come all the way to  I'm in New York to find them you know it's it's I guess a lot of people are still a little bit in the broom closet so hopefully things like this can help people get out more meet each other more because you have not been good for a little while and I loved having you here so that you could reintroduce yourself to people I could see people when you go up to their faces we like I know I know you and then Ryan everyone be all happy and meeting new people and being able to connect replace the networking exactly exactly and I cannot tell you how many pop-up wonderful things are happening they have music every night like boom boom shake will be playing we had riverglen we had Brian hanky that they just have so many people Frenchy and the punk is going to play it's just a lot of fun. There's so many things going on for everybody to have a kids village where they have kids programming and crafts and things for kids to do as well  the place to play there is no supervision you have to supervise your children yourself they must be supervised at all times but sounds like it's a family inclusive event we do all of these things here there's vendors I know you might have gotten a thing or two would I you know what I got to say though and I think every listener is going to be proud of me I want y'all to be proud of shall here for a moment because I did not I repeat I did not buy a Tarot deck you didn't I am I am her witness she did not buy a single tear duct not one not two not many none 0.0 you won't talk about other things like your dirty clothes what tell me one wonderful beautiful thing that you got one wonderful beautiful thing I've got is actually not closed it was a wood-burning of a goddess figured that was the most amazing I don't know if I want to  a picture of burning wood a Michelle Mitchell is an artist here I have some of her are as well on paper I don't have a wood-burning my guy I'm looking at some cuz my going to she's great but yeah that is a gorgeous piece I remember we went to the art show and you went outside and I came out and you're like guess which thing I want to go and I knew exactly which one it was dead and I couldn't even believe it was the one I wanted so I knew that was it was perfect I wasn't going to buy it there so I was really glad that you did because one of us needed that one of us but there are a lot of vendors hear some very creative people and you know that's another thing that you can do is you know support artist support take an artist here so that wasn't the only Workshop that you did now you did one that was a little more serious you want Elsa like did I did I did I didn't do a workshop that  slow deep and it was more to inspire conversation and it was called appropriation vs. appreciation walking the witches line and you know the whole appropriation thing has gone in and out of the news for the last several years and I wanted to kind of open a discussion for people because I think there's a lot of accusations of appropriation out there that aren't necessarily accurate I think it's just sometimes an easy word to throw around but in the same respect there's also that balance of there's a lot of appropriation out there that needs to stop using there is and so you know it was it was not so much a lecture but to open dialogue about appropriation for depreciation what can we do to appreciate that doesn't appropriate or come across this appropriation we had great discussions a lot of the participants had a lot of valuable stuff to say  I think that sometimes having conversations in person with a group of people is the best way to kind of get some ideas going forward and get the greater the greater Consciousness kind of come together you know I just think that it is helpful for people to have dialogue would maybe you are a solitary you are from you know you don't have a community around you or group around you and you know what it doesn't hurt to get together again with some like-minded folks and have some creative conversations yeah and that's another thing that these festivals are absolutely wonderful for us to get people from different backgrounds and get them together and talk about all sorts of things and from for appropriation and versus appreciation all the way to Diana PacSun is here giving a talk everyday on different Norse gods I mean there's a little bit of everything here you can go to Beth and Zeeb who do the the clay have Clay workshops every day making fairy  dry eyes I mean there's a little bit of everything for everybody here no speaking of fun stuff a little for everybody Layla what was your next Workshop my neck starts off as a lot of fun we got to play with chalk talk with you I'm like I love but this one I really love Labyrinth so I did a workshop on how to create labyrinths and we talked a lot about why they were good what they can do for you in your practice and and then we got into how to create a simple Labyrinth because they look very complicated but I found a very simple way to create a labyrinth and I didn't believe feel because I am like the most non artistic person on the planet and you kept telling me this is easy and I'm like no it's not no it's not I who can make a Lab Rats besides Layla now yes you can and so can everybody that came to the workshop we had a great time so I started everyone with the Labyrinth on paper and show them how to draw and basically it's like  connecting the dots I will try to do a short video and we'll put it up on social media so you guys can see how to do it it's that simple but we had everyone do it on paper and once they got it they're removed everything off the floor and Drew it in chalk and then we use cornmeal where it went off into the grass to make the lines and cornmeal and we actually made a labyrinth I would say maybe fifteen feet across and all directions that's actually pretty darn good gas because it was roughly about the pants were about a foot across and was a seventh circuit Labyrinth so yeah I think you nailed it shows about 15 ft yeah but it's not that hard and I will do a video so that was a lot of fun to be able to show people how to do that especially because one of the elemental shrines here is the spirit Shrine and that's taken care of by a group called The Archers each Elemental Shrine each area has a a different group that's basically in charge of maintaining and doing the ritual for the festival and so the archers are  charge of the spirit Shrine and not only do they mow and take care of this giant Labyrinth every year which is stunning by the way they also have in the past built dragons they've built a large dragon puppets that were built to burn we have some pictures of us in front of the very first wireframe of the Dragon the Dragon Shrine so we'll be putting up a lot of pictures from our time here so if you folks have any questions about festivals questions about brush would shoot us an email I'm sending a message because this is truly one of Layla and Ice most favorite places on the planet and we'd love to give you more information about it and talk you into going next year she'll and I if you show up here next year we will personally give you a tour of all of our favorite places of Brushwood half absolutely a hundred percent we will welcome you home we will  call you around we will introduce you to people and then let you loose in the fire Circle it's going to be I will not be responsible for what these people do  I'm going to give back to this festival and enjoy the rest of it while I'm here because every moment is absolutely fantastic but we will put the information in the show description for all of you we appreciate you joining us for this on regularly scheduled programming while we report to from the Brushwood folklore Center so folks keep your suntan lotion on your bug spray handy and get out to a festival and above all keep your witchy

tell you that's a rabbit hole that you won't be thanking me for Sue and I promise you she says that she doesn't have any problems so she doesn't know you know this is a good thing she does have any problems so she's not sure what to ask the cards there's always something to learn though right you don't have to have a problem sometimes I like to just see what comes up and just pull cars at the beginning of the day and just kind of you know see what they have to say doesn't have to necessarily be a question or problem I need solving sometimes it just is information or inside or you know something to think about for the day sometimes it's more about the message than asking a specific question and it definitely doesn't have to be a problem keep playing with them because that's the best best way okay  Middleton New Hampshire which actually isn't too far look at this freaking card look at them so I know you guys are killing me I wish I could give you all of the the Kudos I can I can

perfectly is there such a thing as  by the way don't know and I also am not entirely sure how well a freezer spell would work against the squirrel I'm a big believer that animals have their own magic

light-hearted argument I tripped over a four leaf clover soft bent down and picked it up and handed it to him and then continued with the argument as we walked across the field he couldn't move he was dumbfounded as John the floor and finally was like okay I guess you do trip over four leaf clovers and he was the first one to tell people about it after that it was so funny  I believed you and I saw

Oaks card and spice blend crazy fantastic oh my gosh I cannot wait to try them so I happen to be coming to see you this weekend and I am bringing you all of your gifts that I have gotten over the last month or so  you are going to physically have these in days I'm so excited and I cannot wait to try some kitchen witchery with those herbs I am so so excited that translates to Layla's cooking for me when I go to New York all hell yes happily so bring the weed I'll make the munchies I got you we do want to make sure that we sang everybody who has sent us mail we adore every one of you and please feel free to keep flood in the PO box and for those of you that are like oh well she'll always gets him in that Layla I literally Layla is my witness I take pictures of it before I even leave the post office and then minute I open them I am literally sending her pictures and videos I'm involved in the process every step of the way and make it pretty regularly so she brings me my share so that I get to see the cards and things that you guys send me as well it's all good no worries and you know I just I don't want to negate all of the other male that  Scott we just we were going to do these tonight but every card every letter every package you guys don't even know I have some of our letters not just the ones I got for my birthday but some from you all and other times I have some right at my desk because they're so heartfelt and meaningful when I'm having a bad day I'll read through them I have a couple of them frame over on my work table because they're so beautiful the amazing things that you guys have fun and I really appreciate it I can't even begin to say how fun this is I don't even get to check the mail and I think this is amazingly fun and you know obviously you know this cuz I call you but you know I don't think the listeners realized that there has been times everybody has bad days everybody's life has been a shitshow in it and there's been times I've gone down and got in the mail and I've literally open the stuff in cried hell are we we started this  fun way for us to hang out but I think that we didn't realize the impact we were making an other people's lives and the mail kind of drives at home and yeah you guys much as we give you let me I just that's the best I can do the best words I can put to it you guys give us as much as we give you and we love you all thank you all so much we did talk a little bit so I'm just going to talk a little bit about a very simple spell that you can do and it's for your mailbox of all things we've talked in the past about protecting and Ward in your space and in the area around you I've warded Windows I've warded faucet I've warded televisions you know all the things the entryways into my dwelling and kind of sealed off my dwelling thought to kind of do that with your mailbox people are sending you mail they're sending you a package that they've touched the mail they have licked the damn stamp  I did just see that delivery guy who put the package in his mouth so you know you never know where these things have been so yes and you're getting mail from someone if you're getting maybe a bit even if they send you just some type of advertisement maybe they were having a bad day maybe they don't like their job maybe they don't like anyone that they have to send mail to and that negative energy you know maybe your great Aunt Sally likes to send you crap all the time and you just don't need that negativity in your life there are a couple different things that you can do to protect your mailbox so even if they send you some snail mail that happens to have some dripping nasty on it it's going to get cleanse before it even comes in your house good idea because you know in this day and age you never know who's going to send why and some people are just negative Nellies and that's their personality and you don't need that loose enough  and so what I would recommend is you don't want to like put too much in your mailbox cuz first of all maybe you have a PO Box like we do or you know maybe you share a mailbox and I also think it's kind of illegal in some states to a with mailboxes or put things in there so we don't want to mess around with any kind of law like that would be super thrilled with me going in burning a hole in the side the PO Box mailman opens the mailbox to put peppermint they probably wouldn't be terribly surprised would not be the first one so what I recommend mostly is oils I like oils for this in particular the other fun thing is if you have your own mailbox like I happen to have a mailbox across the street and  plant flowers around it and I think it looks really pretty and it's a very stealthy way to protect your mailbox and you know kind of fit in with your super country neighbors but you can plant mint or hyacinths our daffodils are all plants that have protective qualities and you can just plant those around the base of your mailbox if you're so lucky to have that out there and with the intention of cleansing any mail that comes into that space and then the second part or the first part if you don't have a place to plant anything is the oils you can take a little bit of salt very very fine salt crush it up all nice and fine and then oil like rosemary oil cuz you know we know Rosemary is great for protection and it's the Swiss army knife of herbs and just concentrate on protection and then his wife that around the rim of your mailbox and just refresh that on the first of the month when you do your cinnamon spell or every full moon or whenever you remember or in the case of our PO Box I took a little bit of oil dripping sand just drew a Sigil on the door another perfect way to do it  anytime if you send anything to say to us or anyone who has a mailbox that has a Sigil or is protected like that any good energy get straight through and any negative energy gets immediately grounded immediately in the Gated post office box it's kind of short notice well I think anybody would sending mail to a which is pretty sure that that's probably one of the things that's going on there you don't want to send anything that would just be silly but so yeah so you can do that and my favorite of course is the planting the flowers around the bottom because it looks pretty and it's super stealthy way to have something physical bear to enhance your protection spell but if you can't there are other options  PO Box you can just every once in awhile draw so you'll write on it or run it around the entrance to the mailbox do a quick counterclockwise to banish and then clockwise to steal and you're good to go and the person who sent us inside you know what if I do it wrong what if it's not perfect something like this again you said I had to do a banishing line and I did a regular one oh my God now what what was your intention cuz that's the one in my opinion who cares if you did it frontwards backwards upside-down tension is what my question will be in if your intention is for that protection and in such then that's going to be what you get out of it and I'm going to add to that and stay with your intention start your spell it home say we're going to let's go with this mailbox spell say that you're going to do this mailbox. And you're worried about doing it wrong you've already done an excellent spell work with a candle in a bay leaf we can keep it just that some  at home you can take your oil and your salt and if you have a mortar and pestle or if you have some way to grind that salt fine as you're grinding the salt just ask the salt to help you like she'll said it's your intentions it's Basalt intention to be cleansing and to be protective so just ask it to lens those abilities as you're grinding it all nice and fine same thing with the rosemary oil Rosemary is good for so many different things just ask it to be your protection and cleansing in this particular case as you mix it with the salt and then bring it to your mailbox and then apply it and if you're worried that you applied it wrong take yourself back to Shell said your intention just relax and remember maybe a chance maybe you have a word maybe you text two or three words to remember safety protection cleansing so if you worry that you're doing it wrong you can fall right back on those three key words safety protection cleansing  just allow those ingredients that you have chosen and the words that you have chosen to assist you and to lend their energy to your working into your intention and you're not going to go wrong with that and if you're doing this in a post office like playlist subduing a post office box or something about them watching you on camera I do this I promise you the federal government and I even got a blank twice at you rub an oil on your box  I'm leaving that in so  fearlessness Leyland shall really 12 year old boys  so take your spell oil and apply it to your post office container okay yeah so why I should fly into the container and you're good to go again if you are worried that people are watching you just don't have to be like super fancy about it she'll said she put a sign on the door it just takes a second to draw a star or to draw sujal on the door and the oil and nobody's going to care you know we tend to smoke a little bit too much prior and it's called opal and it's 30% THC speaking my language it's delicious it's very very tasty. I love it so that might be why  I found your box so amusing now real quick because you know I can't have you shared not me I am smoking what's called ozone and the you know you're going to be mad at me but I can't think of what it is but the flavor is banana know I like to pick up my alley but for some reason the stuff just makes me laugh, but I think with that I think we both need to go we need to smoke a little more have a little more tea and maybe go cleanse our box  sending in the email and if you're having trouble finding the show notes just click on any episode and the description where it says what we're going to talk about any episode at the bottom of that you'll find our website you'll find our email address to find how to donate to the show and usually that's where I put any links or any interesting information are so if I say you can find it in the show notes it's the show description at the bottom and if you can't just bombard Layla with email because that makes one more time if you want to send us stuff to make my day back on the broomstick PO Box 106 Salem Mass 01970 I love going to the box and wrapping it with you just need to keep your box with qi  thank you for listening this far as we've gotten very very silly again we very much appreciate all your letters send them to your email. We will see you on Friday and I hope you have your own Solarium to hang out and have a little tea have something a little green and herbal to smoke and stay wise and keep your box witchy people

saying what you want laid in your candle and then be done with it you actually have to power the spell to make what you want to happen happen you gave me flashbacks of microwave toaster oven versus cooking on the stove in the episode the different sources of energy that you can use and what it feels like to raise energy and how to direct its going to get into all sorts of things this is such a good topic that this is actually our second episode on raising energy for spell crafting for more info on this check out episode 51 from I don't even remember how long ago that was but it was a minute

I'll be there for the same Copa Festival which is Friday Saturday and Sunday and also the Sirius Rising Festival which Monday to Sunday the next week and we'll be doing workshops it's not my fault the

bills for the podcast today so  are you guys I would have some serious issues with this you know between the PO box and the website and everything is cost money in and as we like to say a lot it's just show that I so thank you guys from the bottom of her witchy hartsook it's a huge help thank you and we love you and we're so glad that you love listening to us cuz really this is just two best friends chat and and we love that you're along for the ride and we do joke that it would be nice to have this as a job but honestly I'm just happy that you guys help keep the lights on actually I'm just happy that that people find Value and we talked about and that we actually changed people's lives that still blows my mind I love that thank you guys for your email and your real nails and your messages things that you've learned from us things that we've helped she waved I can't tell you as much as you say we inspire you I assure you inspire us  we're very excited to know that a few listeners are coming out to Brushwood to the festival's they do have their own website or swift.com I think I'll put a link to that in the show description as well and I think it's also on mandragora Magic I think they have their festivals there but if you're interested I believe there are still tickets available it is an amazing time and I know that we're going to have one in particular that I know we're going to see Liz can't wait to see you there hey Liz my workshops for Sankofa are everyday almonds charm casting with ordinary objects and walking the winding path creating and using labyrinths in Magic and meditation my two workshops are going to be verbal cardio Mansi as well as appropriation vs. appreciation walking the witches line but what is a Yin without a yes what is Laverne without Shirley and what is shell with  Layla so I have kindly given her a nudge to join in on my workshops with me cuz you know two is better than one that's right there will be doing a radio show together and Frank wonderful head of the radio station there last year figured out how to put the station live on the web and so some of our listeners were able to listen to my radio show direct from Brushwood during the festival and this year Friday morning she'll and I from 11:50 will be doing a radio show I can't even first of all you know I tell you this all the time I hate listening to my own voice and who would have thought a I end up on a podcast that you have roped me into a radio show DJ like what is happening in my life I'm not sure who you even are anymore we actually put a call out for  I said give me some DJ names folks and we got some funny ones I am not going to lie but I haven't settled on one yet but it's got to be something catchy like I don't even know secret shell on the sound waves oh my God DJ sacred do I have like that but we did get some very fun cool funny DJ suggestion names I kind of like that one OK shells DJ name and pipe shelter o o s pronounce like shelter oh babe and put like a whole call sign for you so it would be like this shelter oh your hometown Salem witch putting the itch of the ass.  we also have a DJ named Michelle casting my hype they say is Layla she's been putting a spell on you and your little dog too since she was old enough to put salt rings on the roof get ready to get there which back in your witch hazel in your broom back in your Broom-Hilda brought to you by your two favorite which socks but even Witchiepoo herself would approve of now that I like DJ Layla bones I love it you love me that's so perfect thank you THB in 1971 so if you have any other ideas or if you want to vote on one of those for Shell if you have any ideas for Layla son of man you got it a few days left before our radio show know I am definitely going with that whole like a little paragraph thing even if I pick a different DJ because that's hysterical hysterical  I'm itchy ass hole that that was great but I'll have to see who wrote that and give them a shout out our listeners have missed future Layla so they're going to love that Layla is definitely going to put the link to the radio show in the show notes because if you can't make it to Brushwood you can still listen and it's fun because it's live and it won't just be us you can listen to all of the radio show is I believe they go from like 10 till 5 or 10 till 7 every day of the festival's so you'll be able to listen to all sorts of Music talk shows everything it's all run by volunteers and Frank so it is a lot of fun you get to listen to all types of music we're going to do a particularly witchy focused set for are free  a show I think you don't want to miss it all right so this episode again just kind of going to be a little bit of a very 2024 about how to raise energy how do you actually get a spell to work and I'm going to bring up Aleister Crowley again you know he does he was not a great person you love to hate him and hate to love him yeah he did have some very interesting ideas about magic he was very smart and one of the things he said magic is the science and art of causing change to occur in Conformity with the will and he capitalized the word will because that's the important part and will and intent are like the same thing but he also means by will your force your energy your life Forrest he felt that everything in the world wants to be  an alignment that everything has energies and that your will is your way of getting everything into alignment with your purpose with your path and that's really what you need power spells is gather your will your energy gather the will of other things and focus it into your intent damn that Crowley City guy still a weirdo so let's move on from Crowley but that is the basis of magic in our last episode about this episode 51 you know we did talk about a varying amount of methods you could use to raise energy and what works for you might be different for the next person you know how you feel that energy flow through you or you know maybe you don't feel energy flowing through you if it's drumming or maybe you don't feel it if it's chanting or meditating so just because we talk  either in the previous episode of this episode different things are going to work for different people depending on how you feel that energy and that's a really excellent point because it also is going to depend on your modality of magic like right where do you Source your energy shell and I do a lot of combination it's mostly our own will but we also draw energy from an animistic forest from the Earth from other things we work with the energies that are all around us another modality is Spirit driven a lot of people will power their spouse with spirit Spirit guides ancestors and go with that energy strictly shell and I also work with that energy and there's other mental energies as well that you can use psychological energies there's chaos magic do depending on your magic modality will also depend on how you raised him father sent to you as well another point is there are people that have a very hard  time with visualization and for whatever reason it's just not something they're they're able to do easily so you know some of these methods might not work for them are as chanting singing dancing may be their preferred method because it's something physical and you know when you're drumming you feel that drum beat in your car or you know when you're chanting or singing you're feeling that in those vibrations go through you as you sing and chant so what is your best method is going to be different and you're going to have to kind of try and I guess all to figure out where do you best feel that energy flowing through you exactly and in this episode we're going to talk to you a lot about how to feel it like in the other episode we did talk about some different exercises and things that you could do to raise energy this episode we want to focus  moron Basics how do you feel that energy what can you do to actually feel the magical energy and then start to work with it from there so we're going to talk about a few different things and first I want to make sure that you know what energy were talking about internal energy can feel like strong emotions when you're so excited that you feel like your body is buzzing when you're so mad that you feel like you might explode you're so happy that you feel a glow emanating from inside you when you stare at someone to get them to look at you or have you ever had a hunch and had to be right more often than I care to admit that's all internal energy outside energy feels more like have you ever walked into a room and felt the tension even though no one was saying anything or been near a person or group of people and just been like a dick or someone that drains your energy even though they seem perfectly fine you're just always drained after work or someone who always seemed  to make you feel up and energize or a good one for us have you ever been to a festival or a concert and just felt those waves of energy and excitement coming off the crowd that is energy that is Magic that is power that you can use if you know how to tap into it and if you know how to raise it so think of those feelings I wanted to kind of just start with chanting and I know that we did talk about that and the previous episode but there's a couple chance that you know I learned these things way back in the nineteen hundreds and I don't know if it's because we did it a lot or if they just resonated so deep but it's almost like now you know decades on if I get into a Zone and start these chance that cone of power is almost like instantly there and you know I guess what she can't you pick is going to depend on what your purpose  or maybe you have a particular chant you do every time but I do have two that were probably my most favorite that we used whether it was in our community in Upstate New York or if it was in our old coven or if it was just a bunch of us in our friends doing something and I think the two that have stuck with me the most we all come from the goddess I do remember that you're going to make me sing it we all come from the guy and to her we shall return the ring to the ocean come from the God we are the two most fearsome real singers in the show description the other one is I don't know what it might have been because it's about which I know you  and those are chance that we're not unique to our community those everywhere so if you learn those chance and the thing with chance is repeated words are powerful working with words and with breath to raise energy is something that people have been doing since there have been people I find Habit to be the easiest way to kind of get there for lack of a better a better way to say it you know to get into that space to get into Alpha raising energy the whole bet you know repetition has a purpose I think and breathwork does as well and in Hinduism and Buddhism there's this idea of Prana Breath of Life and so chanting you're using that Breath of Life that is powerful in itself so you're adding words that have power words like those  Champs that we just said have been repeated over and over again by Earth worshiping goddess and God worshiping pagans and heathens so they have this power of repetition and of History you can also make up a chant I'd make one up I was thinking about an exercise that people could do to work with brass and with chance that they can actually feel that energy pick one of those chance or I wrote one that's really short and dark of night The Witches Hour I call my guys and raise my power I love them it's really short it's really Punchy again I like rhyming shit start with a whisper and you don't have to say it just whisper it  I call my guys and I just keep gradually getting louder and louder and louder more volume more power in dark of night The Witches Hour I called my guys I raise my power and dark of night The Witches Hour I call my guys I raise my power and just keep going with that literally like a physical representation of the voice in the brass and the the sound and the voice all of it works together and you'll start to feel that physically you might feel yourself moving rhythmically because your body is starting to get involved and raise that energy and so just keep repeating that as you feel the energy the more you feel it the louder you get then once you get the energy up the idea is to gather it and in the previous episode I talked about Gathering that you're Spencer a ball at your Center or another easy way especially with a chant is very often you can hold something in your hands like a crow  Dolores small statue and as you're champing push that energy into the object that you're holding and then you can hold on to that and use it in a l Spell the same exact thing with drumming all the way up to the point of holding something in your hand so you know to direct that because obviously you're driving with drumming you know start that slow beat and as you make it louder make it faster and you know as you're going louder and faster same concept erasing that at some time in the past what we've done is kind of your your almost going so fast and so hard you almost like don't even know what your hands are doing anymore and then it just poop and he almost collapsed for lack of a better word and sometimes we have physically collapsed physical exertion that mental exertion all of that is energy  all of that is power that you can use to power your spouse no Lele you talked about a minute ago that you can say hold a crystal in your hand and directed into that then what what if you are just raising energy to store it into an object like a crystal to use for a later day then we know we have done this with alter tools we have done this with stones and crystals so I gather up all my energy let's say full moon in all we at we have a full moon going on this week and I want to take that full moon energy take some of this powerful energy going out and about my own energy energy from the earth and I want to put it in will say a quartz crystal  so I have this energy in that Crystal and now next week I end up wanting needing having to do a spell how can I utilize the energy in that Crystal in my spell that's a week from now now you've basically created a battery you can do with knots you can do crystals are great because they have that Matrix you can do with anything metal that you can pretty much do with anything but some items hold energy better than others so now you have a crystal battery that you have charged with the energy of Love or happiness or luck or anger or whatever you have charged it with so now you're doing a love spell and you grab the rose quartz that you have practice raising love energy with and it's full so now when you do your raising energy you ask that item hey Rose Quartz give me that energy back that I charged you with so now when you're doing your spell you have all that extra energy from that Crystal that you can then  raw into you add it to the other energy that you're raising now your spell is that much more powerful question this is a left turn and obviously I know the answer but that's not the point of this we have in Random episodes and people all over the Facebook and The Tick Tock talk about put all your shit out under the full moon or or in the Sun and get that sun energy and get that full moon energy I'm saying you know you Gathering the energy so are we saying that it is the same concept and then you can utilize that energy later you're saying exactly that you put your crystal out on the full moon this week and then maybe on the new moon you want need have to to do a spell you can utilize that Crystal and the  gee that you would go and you lie so that later but you still going to have to put your own energy into it the concept of energy everything has energy all things have energy all people have energy plants crystals Stones the Earth the Sun the moon everything everything has energy songs have energy you know emotion is energy so you don't have to just use the energy that's in your physical body some of us start right off the bat being able to do whether magic and change the color of our hair was just so sick of our wrist not really but it would be nice to go and floated down gently but others of us have to work at that we have to train ourselves just like you do with any sport you train yourself to have more energy reserves and to be able to gather more  however even those powerful which isn't just going to reach into themselves to pull out this energy they're going to have Spell components that lend their energy they're going to have spell batteries that they have charged with energy they're going to draw on the energy of the their land Spirits their ancestors and guides they're going to draw on the energy of the earth beneath them that they have created a relationship with drawn the energy of the sun they're going to ask Tecate to bring her energy in and they're going to leave that energy into their working so how do we do that we need to differentiate our energy and pull in other energy how do you like to Paul energy in from other sources not just a battery well I think it's going to depend on what I'm doing and what I'm adding to it if I'm just doing something with a handful of crystals that's going to be a little different than a  I'm pulling energy from herbs you know with crystals I'm going to put it in my hands I'm going to feel it you know I'm going to have a sexy time with my crystal you know you do you kind of like merge my energy with the energy in the Crystal and almost brings that visually in in my mind trying to pull that out of the Crystal and into me but then I may have my athame that I have charged which is more I'm not pulling the energy from it but using it as an extension of my hand oh you just brought up two awesome points but I totally have to okay all right so first thing that you said was visualize and that is a huge part of energy and even if you can't visualize even if you if you think in words like some of us to you  still use those ideas visualizing what you want visualizing the energy Imagining the energy creating that idea in your mind is very powerful and will work and you can feel the energy move so visualization and visualization exercises are extremely important and was that practice does make perfect so you just got to keep practicing the other thing that you said that I absolutely love his tools can be used not only to store energy but to direct it and how often do you see like a magician with a wand or a staff or an athame because those are excellent tools to Direct Energy I happen to have this this little wand that I got one of my local Salem stores and generally for most ritual purposes I like my wand to be made of wood I personally prefer Willow but this one I used for different things  and this is completely made of crystals it is a labradorite main base it's got a point quartz crystal on the bottom and then it's got a sphere quartz crystal on the top and then if I don't know eight little different colored ones down the base of it this would be something because it's all made out of stones and crystals that I would use more to direct energy than say my metal half May that's just amazing because I kind of feel that more in a crystal than I do in a metal and also a crystal is more likely to be able to amplify especially that one in particular is designed to amplify energy and has all the chakra colors going down. The quartz crystal at the end sign to channel your energy and amplify it where as just a metal athame is more the scientist to wrecked it in your energy  think of the tip like a laser pointer channeling all the energy that you've gathered and shooting it like an arrow to your goal and kind of when I think of my wand that's made out of the willow I feel that not that it can't Direct Energy and in what not but I just feel that I get more more out of out of this Crystal one just because it's Crystal in that would you know what I mean I mean I'm not knocking would no pun intended but I feel this is specifically designed in my opinion to be directing energy when I need to do that part of the reason for that is a lot of people believe and I'm one of them that magical energy acts a lot like electricity or water when you're directing electricity crystals can amplify electricity and amplify that light and make it react in all sorts of interesting beautiful ways so you can direct it and amplify it with a crystal metal electricity runs straight down metal not a  find it but it's running straight through it and write out the point and that's what you want to do with your energy and a spell as you want to concentrate it and run it straight out a point directly to your purpose and an athame I want to help you do that now would is not an excellent conductor of electricity but water and electricity can flow along that you can still use that to direct your will and to Direct Energy is going to feel different it's going to be more earthy it's going to be more slow it's going to be more malleable like a willow again that like-for-like sympathetic magic because it's rooted in the ground that Willow Branch still remembers being a tree and so it remembers being part of Mother Earth and being part of that energy so it's going to have a little bit of a different feel to it you should meditate and visualize with each of your tools with you can kind of get an idea of how the energy feels for you but then once you find what works for you  you know you may get all of the same thing inside of that Willow Wind that I get out of the Crystal limed and you know you may be more of that Earth the ground type of person where is I'm kind of like that electric charge just waiting to burst do you know and I kind of need that Crystal to not only direct it but also kind of add to it and that's why I like assembling a team that's why intention and will is totally enough but I love working with a team I like having my tools around me helping add their energy to my working I think it just makes it so much more beautiful to weave those energies together once you start working a lot of your tools in this manner it's almost like they become an extension of you or like an old friend they're no longer a thing on your  alter or anything on your shelf for a thing on your desk you start forming a personal relationship with these tools and the better that relationship is the easier everything I think it is to work with flow together and come together in this succinct beautiful magical working relationships and one of the ways to do that is to practice raising energy and directing it with your tools cuz you can do that without necessarily having a spell in mind or in the middle of a ritual you know you can you can work with indirect just as a kind of an exercise to get that practice to create that relationship in to learn what ways of raising works best for you try six or seven or eight different methods  before you feel what flower is best through you know the energy that were talking about you can feel it as a motion you can feel it as physical exertion I you can feel it as mental energy have you ever taken a test and felt completely drained afterwards yeah yeah because you were using all that mental energy that's energy you can use the power spell I know we have done this have you ever been in a group of friends and you just start laughing so hard that you can't stop and as soon as one of you stops you look at each other and start laughing all over again and you never really seemed to know why you might have even forgotten why but that infectious energy is passing around the whole group making everyone laugh and excited and happy that's magic that's energy you can harness and you can feel it quite hot rage and and we know she'll needs to not direct that it people in traffic because it causes problems  you know I try to be good I tried to be good or another good way to think about how that energy feels as if you ever been in the zone have you ever been completely vibing with something that you're doing you're doing sports and everything is working perfectly you're creating something and it just everything falls into place perfectly in the zone and everything is going so good that's a magical place that is energy you're in the flow of energy right there and those feelings if you remember those feelings you can use those to raise that energy in your body is incredibly potent sex will get you into that place if you're doing it right anything physical anything that you truly enjoy doing singing chanting like we were talking about earlier can get you into that sensation and that's where the magic is that's where the energy is that I have raised energy in the past so you know I love my Spotify  I do I love that sometimes it'll randomly come up and I'm like oh my God  play the playlist blend but as a lot of us to do I kind of have one playlist that's kind of just which you know I got my I got my stuff and sometimes that music can be an energy razor and I guess you have to really be kind of a music person to get it but if you set your playlist just right you can use music to be that energy razor on there I promise you'll feel some energy I mean I've been mad before I listen to some angry music and it really wasn't productive cuz it just kind of expanded my anger or happy unless some happy music makes you happy or you're sad and you listen to sad music and it makes you sad or same concept and so I have curated a witchy playlist that  I could use to get to that energy racing space if I needed to might need to rearrange a few songs you know I can I can use that as well if you're not a singer you know maybe you're embarrassed sang even to yourself or even around yourself maybe you're too self-conscious to dance curator playlist start with maybe slow easy meditative music before you get to the Raging drumming music but whatever it takes to get there with the options of raising energy are only limited to your mind stopping you one of my favorite ways to feel energy into practice raising energy actually came from one of our coven meets back in the day your ex he used to talk about his hands he would say his hands turned on you know I was worried you were going to take this down a sexual past but note the gotta ruin my ex has  send love you she would talk about his hands turning on and what he meant was sometimes and we would talk about magical energy without even realizing it he would start to raise energy and he could feel it in the center of his hands his palms but start to get hot you feel the heat of that energy raising right there I use this because I can feel it right now just talking about it I can feel it it's such an easy way to raise and Direct Energy that I used it as a basis as an exercise for my student so what you do think of a bubble bath or doing the dishes and you have lots and lots of Suds big piles of little tiny sudsy bubbles imagine in your head again we're getting into a little bit of visualization here but just think about all these bubbles the time in your life when you had the biggest piles of bubbles in front of you ever blows up in your hands and then switch them so your hands are almost in a prayer position Palm to Palm finger to finger but about an inch apart from each other and imagine that between them you have a lair  bubble bubble soap now move your hands in and out real quick just about an inch or so in front of your face and you can feel that energy between them you can feel the warmth and you can almost feel those soap bubbles between your hands if you're having trouble feeling it make us think of Bubbles and do it with real bubbles and then try it again without them but practice that focus on that so you can feel your palms get warm and you can feel the energy you can feel those soap bubble energy almost like the air is thick between your hands and practice until you can bring your hands really far apart and still feel that energy bouncing back and forth between them and keep practicing until you can turn your hands on and off at will and this is the energy of your body that you are drawing up bringing through your arms and pushing into your palms Reiki Masters to the site you're into Reiki shall I know this is something you know how to do so this is an exercise that you can do to help you feel that energy and learn to draw and direct it into your  and then into a small space and since you had to bring up how I am knowledgeable of this since I was first hand to him doing this frequently I can give you some insight or two you know we've talked about how we have gotten ourselves to a point that we can you know do a few things and in within a minute or so be an alpha I will say that he kind of snapped himself into Alpha first and then they would kind of turn on and one thing he would kind of do at the end not really like a clap but almost kind of like his hands together and then pull them apart and that kind of broke and it off Alpha Park kind of throwing himself into Alpha in the beginning I'm not saying it was key to it but it definitely didn't hurt you know you're kind of focusing your getting your you're getting in that magical mental space  he doing that magical mental stuff and getting into that magical mental space is not a necessary part but it really does help another tool in your toolbox exactly exactly so we talked about how to feel the energy how to raise the energy directing the energy to your purpose is the next step is the last step how do you direct it to your purpose and we talked a little bit about the cone of Power are using an athame or a want and the reason for that is because again sympathetic magic the doctrine of signatures says that if you want to direct a spell to a purpose specific point and you should point that it you should throw an arrow to it you should point out it with a pointer you should point out it with your wand so take all of your energy like a cone bigger at the bottom you're Gathering it all in and then you're directing it to a single-purpose your will your intent that one point and you're throwing all of that energy to that point  letting it go and go off and take care of what you've told it to do and you know that's where sometimes thing is like you know if you wrote something on a bay leaf for example you can raise that energy and then directed into that bay leaf and then do whatever you're going to do with it burn it slowed it whatever but you know having that focal point but if you don't have a focal point you know maybe maybe your smile is something like you know you're trying to do to gain prosperity in your life and maybe it's just more of a directing your energy and your focus out to the universe you know your call to the universe for this site what specific but not too specific thing so you know who have an object or what have you took to direct it in that's fabulous but if you don't  you can also direct your what I what I do is direct you're asked out to the universe send it to the universe that's or send it to your deity or your guys are your ancestors to whoever or whatever to work you're well there's been times when even my buddy list of the time when you are so mad have you ever been so pissed off the rage just builds up in you until you just have to scream and you scream it out to the universe and then you can take a big breasts and you're calmer and you're a little more centered you just threw a whole bunch of energy to the universe why are you telling people what I did last week telling all your secrets shall everyone so that's what you're doing and to spell it hopefully it's not always rage but whatever energy you're raising it's that same type of feeling your building and building and building it and it has to have a release of some  so your release is burning something so that the energy can go off to the universe or to your ancestors or maybe you're singing in your clapping at the end and pushing or maybe your we talked in an old episode about putting all of that energy into an eggshell jar an eggshell jar spell and then physically throwing it while you're releasing the energy so the kinetic energy matches the spell energy in your physically throwing it you know that's what you want to kind of visualize or actually do to get that energy out out of you and working towards your spell goal but as much as is you're doing that you still after you've done all of these said things want to ground and Center to release any residual energy that you may be carrying because if you don't think of like a live wire that's come down in a storm and it's just kind of flaw  turn around in the road because they're still electricity pumping through it even though it's broke its connection that's kind of how you are until you ground and sent her and that can really mess with you you don't want to be that Untamed Livewire that's just out of control energetically and you also conversely you don't want to have put so much of your own energy into this and so much energy and so much of your own physical and mental and psychic energy that now your depleted now you're tired now you're cranky now you're sore both of those are possible after you've done a working like literally go eat something have bread and cheese have a favorite at the end eating something doing something ordinary and mundane house bring you back to the physical helps bring you back to a center but you can take it one step further as well and literally ground release that energy and  picture yourself coming to a balance so release the energy into the Earth imagine it flowing back up into you until you are refreshed and renewed and in perfect balance of the most you know I am a food lover I like food and a lot of traditional covens and working groups and in sometimes just individual solo practitioners follow the concept of kind of the cakes and Ale at the end of a ritual or at the end of my coven I love when it comes out you just said cakes and ale so my my lovely cousin you know we we do the cakes and Ale I'm going to call him cuz that's just what I call him according to Raymond Buckland Big Blue Book and somewhat, and we can Circle cakes in a list of ritual name given to the food and drink that you have to close out your spell original it was  vital part of any magical working and is supposed to Aid in properly grounding and centering you eating food is an easy way to remind you that you have a body and are part of the physical world generally you know it's like so there was this one time while the person who was bringing the cornbread last-minute couldn't come to the ritual did any of us think of that no so here we are and we're like oh shit we need our cornbread and the closest we could find Fritos corn chips and because honey is a part of our personal rituals honey barbecue Fritos corn chips oh my God here we are you not drizzling honey I'm corn chips I'm about to good to eat to ground at the end of the ritual and can I tell you it was the most delightful snack we ever invented  to all my apps in Salem we are the inventors of corn chips dipped in Honey that's kind of hilarious each of us took a bite we're like huh but yeah so I'm a big food grounding person we talked to in other episodes of in our own community and in our old Cotton how we would physically go down to the ground at the end of raising in and putting out the energy we would physically touch the ground and talk about releasing any access at 2 and then coming to a balance and then we would go eat there would be Feast afterward bring all sorts of food and everyone would face after just socializing and feasting just doing ordinary mundane things there's something about digesting food I guess he's been digesting that helps bring you back to your body from that magical place it brings you back from the Hedge you come back to the this world and food really helps with that however you eat it even if it's weird  Fritos and honey whatever it happens to be at can help a lot I feel like putting food and drink and you put you back into reality you know because when you're in the alpha State and when you're in that magical place you are in a different reality and food and drink are not a part of that you are all-powerful God a warrior queen you are moving the energies of the universe and of life itself you don't need to eat your an all-powerful being but show likes corn chips and honey yeah yeah so you start waving corn chips and honey and all the sudden you go from powerful Warrior which back to Shell before we go visualization exercise that you can use to help you Direct Energy and this involves schedule work for symbol work isn't  so pick a symbol or a schedule that you would like to charge it can even be a physical object but I prefer something mental so think of an image think of a heart okay you're going to self love spell so think of the image of a heart so get yourself into a nice meditative space and you're going to do what's called box breathing and Breath Again is a really good way to help you connect with your own energy and what box breathing is if you breathe in for a count of four hold your breath for a count of four breathe out for a count of four and then hold your breath again before I count to 4 and then keep doing that focus on your breath while you're doing the Box breathing in your mind I think of a heart start constructing a heart just a symbol of a heart and once you're able to construct the image of the heart start filling it with the energy that you feel coming up from your core as you're doing this box breathing feel that heart with the energy  picture it getting more and more clear in your mind whatever symbol you have picked once you've done that then hold that image in Your Mind release it to the universe with your intent in this case self-love and then bring yourself back to Center focusing on visualizing an image and pushing your energy into that image is a good way to learn how to power symbols I like so I've been trying to get more into sigils I think I was afraid of him cuz I'm so not see but I like that every day you did have a feeling you're going to make one of my things I love when I'm out and I like to make a schedule for my day every single day so of course I'm going to drag you into it we should do henna sigils used to do henna all the time you were like the  master I was just your canvas looks like a preschooler but I've had a lot of fun with it and I appreciate that all right so practice practice practice raising energy feeling that energy and directing that energy and using that in your spell work is what's really going to make them work that's where the power comes so when you are creating your spouse or if you are utilizing a spell that was created by someone else remember this is the key it's not just following the pages in the directions in the posts online there has to be that energy raising in directing or the rest is just words so hopefully you will all be able to try some of these out and see how they work for you see what works best for you like we said in the beginning  I guess when your physical movement maybe it's going to be chanting singing drumming be something we didn't think of yeah however you prefer to raise energy you're going to have to practice it and try a few different ways and see what works best so I really hope that you all take this opportunity to piece together the last three episodes and if you haven't tried to create a spell or or to implement a spell I hope this gives you the courage and the info to do so and if it does tell us all about it you know how to get us on the socials are months of your spellcrafting summer and hopefully these last three episodes have given you a basis to do all sorts of magical workings between now and September so we will be getting out for some festivals out and about coming up in the next few months will be able to see us all over the place but we are going to have another series coming out in the next month or so

----------------------------------------
welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your collagen and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick and this is part two of our three-part spellcrafting series for a witch's spell craft summer last week we talked about Spell components and correspondence and this episode it's all about how to write your own spells that get results and I'm sure she'll and I'm just so excited to be able to be on step to where we kind of talked about putting it all together because I look at this is the fun part this is like literally were you make the magic I think that that's something we'll dive into to it can be an actual craft so I'm really excited to talk about spellcrafting let's put it all together we got it and it says we got our ingredients we got our tools now it's the step where people tend to get very confused and they want to look up a spell on whatever get love in their life find a new job at Block in their life in a new Romance  so what do you do next after you found your ingredients that match your correspondences how do you write a spout what is a spell well I say there's so much I feel like a record in 10 and I think a lot of people feel that when you write a spell that it has to be some Whimsical rhyming fantasized when it can really just be like you no bring love to me bring me my desires bring me what I'm looking for this doesn't have to be stuff that they feel like it has to be this like 10 paragraph long rhyming thing and it doesn't spell is essentially a structure a scaffolding for you to raise your energy and direct it towards your intention that's all it is your intention written down yeah it's a framework for your intention for you to ask the universe or tell the universe this is what I desire  and this is the energy I'm putting towards it that's all it is it's a framework and the best way to start is what is my intention what do I want to get out of this and that's the first place that you should start when I think of the money so you know we both been doing this for quite some time and you know sometimes it's just a very simple I would like to attract money to me I would like to attract money to me I would like to attract money to me it's not even anything that has some a lot of verbiage to it it's all about the antenna in my intent is I would like to bring money to me so that's kind of the Mantra of my spell what you're talking about is a very simple Bare Bones spell what is it the kernel of every spell is literally just a statement of intent I want a new job I have a new job that could be your whole spell right there on the flip side I think sometimes when things are more part of a ritual something a little more formal something a little  or long-term then you may want to take the time to maybe write out something still doesn't necessarily have to be rhyming but you know you may want to write out like a paragraph or two of a spell to kind of layout long-term framework long-term intentions so I think really your goal or what you're doing the spell for is going to dictate how you want to put it together you know it's just going to be just something short and sweet and simple and compact or is this some grandiose long-term thing as Step 1 and that is defining what is this spell for you need to know what that is and I have two rules for your attention when you write down the goal of your spell number one don't be too vague and number two don't be too specific  that's it those are my two rules for when you write down what you want out of this fell well and the reason for that is because when you're asking the universe for something when you're directing your will to something you need to definitely have a goal you can't be too vague you can't say I want success because the universe then has a very wide leeway Grant success to you specific so you need to State realistic goals realistically you would like to have and stated in a present intention words are very powerful to your magical brain into the universe words have extreme power what you state is reality what you tell your subconscious is your reality so when you state your intention it really should be I have the best job that suits my  satisfies my life goals and makes me feel fulfilled agree 110% on all of that but you know in the same respect you don't want to be specific with things especially when it comes to romance and love you know you don't want to be I want Joe Blow from down the street who works at the Kwik-E-Mart third shift to be my next husband you want to be super specific because you know Joe Blow down at the gas station might be an abusive drunk in love that was meant for you you don't bring your perfect love to you and to your life if you have it you would say I have a relationship that is strong and loving feeling and list the qualities in that relationship that you need in a relationship to a person but just ate what you want out of a relationship I have I have a thing  with how you're saying I I sometimes have a hard time and I'm sure other people do too with the stating it like you already have it I don't know why that comes hard for me I don't know if it's a to Humble thing too presumptuous kind of thing it's hard for me to read these things in a I already have it context I always generally go more for the asking for contacts and you know how I could be doing it all wrong and have been all this time with the comfortability is that a word with being comfortable with speaking of it in the context of it having already happened and in spellcraft you need to be comfortable with what you're saying so obviously you've been doing spellcraft for a very long time and it's worked for you say I want this I would like this to come to me please give me this for me that feels too much like begging so by stating what you have in present tense  only do I feel that it makes the spell more powerful and more like I am in control of the energy I also know that there is psychology behind stating your intention as if you already have the way that your subconscious works is very literal and so I don't want my subconscious to always be asking I want my subconscious to feel like it has it and that gets into a manifestation principles as well as attraction which I don't know hundred percent agree but some of it works by putting out there that you already have this thing like you buy a blue car and now you see blue cars everywhere so when you tell yourself feels like you have this thing it's easier for it to draw it into your life so if it works for you by asking go with it there's absolutely nothing wrong with that but the reason why a lot of people say stated as if you have it is to keep your magical brain and  and working as if it has it because again subconscious is like a toddler your magical brain is extremely literal sometimes it's just I don't know why but I feel weird being presumptuous like that okay I'm going to skip ahead to the very end because this is a very similar thing at the end of your spell and we'll go over it again at the end I promise but at the end of your spell a lot of people will say so yes it will say so mote it be and that can feel really weird because it's very formal so mote it be some people don't even know what that means feel that way with that so that's just weird and that's okay everybody is magical working is going to be very individual but the reason I'm saying this is because a lot of people feel very  we are old is this weird so mote it be I have to stay at the end and really it just moat is Will so will it be you're basically just saying this is what's going to happen so you don't have to say that I do recommend that you say something the same thing repeatedly because your subconscious your magical brain is very literal is very toddler like it likes to know what to expect and that gives it that repetition that magical quality so you recommend you find a phrase that works to help you know when a spell is ended but it doesn't have to be so mote it be if that feels weird to you good I'm not the only strange one out there but you know  I do think that having some sort of something written down helps because especially for me what you know in the moment I might have forgotten something awesome I should have said and I remained I came up with something I forgot it is sometimes I feel like if I personally write something down that it almost gives it more validity maybe if I ask for it but if it feels like as a permanent thing I say something out loud but I also like to burn things and spells frequently and do you know when you're making your plan for your spell first step  Define your goal what do you want what is your intention and write that down then you should write down different items deities energies the things that we talked about in the first episode of this series what items are you going to gather it should be things that you have in stock what do you have in your kitchen what do you have in your altar in your ritual cupboard one thing I like to do in this particular part of the process is you know a lot of things have different correspondences different significances so I try to just focus on what does this particular thing mean to the spell I'm doing right now like I don't need to write down that 85 uses for bay leaves just the one that's applicable overburdened with kind of all the extras and you're focused on your intent  stress cuz I got a lot of things have multiple correspondences and you just want you just want to stick to the nitty-gritty what's your focus what's your what's your immediate intent and Scott and gather your ingredients but I have your attention and you have a bunch of Spell components that match that intention your next thing what kind of spell are you doing is this a one-and-done kind of spell is it a longer acting spell is a spell that you'll need to do over multiple days or multiple times what kind of spell are you doing and that should match your purpose if this is a I'm going to put someone in the freezer spell that's pretty much a one-and-done kind of thing gather your ingredients you do your spell you put them in the freezer or done is this going to be a jar spell a lot of people like to do the jar spells I only think you should jar up your magic if it needs to be seen or carried or used as a token or Talisman in some way and then there's what I like to color  spell that is something that I do some sort of spell work and either have it on my altar or if it's something burnable burn on my altar I don't know there's probably some bucket name for it but I just called an altar spell and this goes a lot back to like-for-like Magic sympathetic magic and the doctrine of signatures and we talked about in a quart in the correspondences episode because the type of spell you choose should correspond to intention you have exactly freezer spell quick done over with but if you're doing something where you want to draw energies into your life maybe you want to literally have a candle set on the far side of your altar and every day at a certain time you do a spell and you bring it one step closer and then one step closer and that represents drawing in that energy so what you do for your spouse should match what's your intention is what you want to get out of it  another way to look at it as representing the actions that you want to happen in the world by doing similar representative actions in yourself you are so hard to make sure that the type of spell you're intending to do you have the tools for for example if you're going to try to do a a candle spell you are going to need the candles of course whatever you need with what you've got at home it's a great excuse to come it is but I think that I think you you reminded me of something you know you can also do a spell with as much as we talked the whole episode on correspondences make sure I interjected you can do a spell without any sort of anything if it comes down to it just you and your friend all of this applies if you're not going to use any items that all you're going to write your intent you're still going to write your correspondences.  especially if you don't have Spell components to help you raise that energy and get into that land Spirits are other energies that you work with to help bring that and to bring that energy into your space so you can still do this without any items whatsoever so once you figure out what type of spell that's where you're really going to kind of get into the back injure your ingredients your correspondences so you know are you making an incense with the Arabs who gathered the stones are you meditating with a crystal grid take the components that you spell how are you going to use those coins in your spell so this is where you know I kind of take stock of this is what I picked this is my intent  makes my path forward you know what I have what my intention isn't going to utilize those what makes you feel which he and Powerful do you like burning things like she'll do you like candle magick do you like carving rooms in the candles or drawing sigils do you like chance do you like dancing what makes you feel witchy incorporate that with your components into the framework of your spell make that part of of the spell that you're doing and again make it match if you're asking for something you might want to put runes around a candle or write it on a bay leaf and burn it because that sends it to the universe maybe you've got a yarn in your braiding it intentions into your spell you know figure out how am I utilize these for my end  something fun like weaving you know weaving chords make rounds these are all grown types of spells that are like fun craft so to say those again should fit with your intention if you want to draw something into you maybe weaving or crown and thinking of pulling in that energy and holding it in that we've or those not that could be part of your spell and it matches with what your intention is and you know there's been times during certain because of the type of thing I was doing I would either braids braids my hair you know kind of tying those things together making those buying just so anything goes I think is the best part of spellcraft it's what I have and what do I want to do with it and you know I don't want to say there's no rules but there's no rules you know I have six herbs for Stones three coins  half a candle what am I doing with this actually sometimes part of the fun of it and you can absolutely take parts of spells that you see on Tik-Tok are you find on Reddit your Facebook or you've heard someone else talk about you can absolutely take those and modify that to fit in your spell episodes in the past do the tailor it to you and your situation your spell these exact words might have worked for someone else but that doesn't mean those exact words are going to resonate with you and your spelling and in your ingredients in you're working so take those things and then put your own personality and twisted magic into them so you've read what you're going to do what you're going to do with with and what the main part of your spell is going to be  now the next part that you need to decide is how are you going to raise energy to empower the spell and we'll talk more specifics on raising energy directing energy in the next episode just for now know that that will be part of your spell framework is how do I now raise energy to empower the spell that I just did you know I'm glad we're going to actually spend a whole different episode on that because I think this is another piece of the puzzle that people find be a little scary the raising energy part whether it's I don't know what to do I don't know how to do it I don't know if I'm doing it right so I'm I really think that'll be a good one for folks to tune into because  I think getting through the hurdle of your own mind of what you think is the hard part so what you think of the scary parts once you do it you're like oh you know this is where that part comes in and you can decide how you best likes to raise energy do you like to chant I I know you mentioned shall that you don't love reimy chance but I hate to say it there in a mazing way to raise energy no no no I like chance I just don't like rhythmic reading  in my mind that makes so much sense by the way chance powerful to your subconscious mind into your magical brain for an example of that just think of your favorite nursery rhyme  there is a reason why those stick with you your whole life actually I was just thinking about like nine different chance that we knew back in the 1990s that I'll just flooded in my mind all that yes and repetition is a huge reason why these hold power against your magical brain loves repetition so pick a type of raising energy that works for you maybe you like to chance maybe like to drum maybe you like to have sex or an orgasm maybe you like to dance maybe you like to run around maybe you just gather the energy with your arms in your will and directed however you choose to do that find one that works for you and then repeat it over and over again until it becomes second nature I just literally had the 12 year old boy go right through my head and I'll repeat it right that down on your framework raising energy and what your preferred method of raising that energy is then directed  and however you choose to Direct Energy directly to the universe to enact your will to basically I kind of put your spell in motion that right if you don't Empower your spell all you've basically done is is a kind of a nice little meditation for yourself explain this to my kids that raising energy was like getting the rocket ready for liftoff and then directing it was like it lifting off and that's you know that is you know I love to have my weird analogies but that's a good one you know you have to kind of build up all of that that fuel to get it off into the universe you can wrap that into other parts of the spell it the raising energy doesn't have to be separate from the crafting that you're doing maybe you could be doing your chant while you're putting all of your incense ingredients together and directing and raising the energy into those ingredients while you're asking them for their  even your spouse they can all be happening at the same time if you choose or they can all be separate parts you know I've I've done things before way I've made incense blend is a part of a spell and kind of did I won't I won't say it right now but did a chance that we are both very familiar with while mixing my little incense food in Mexico and everybody has their own way but again as long as whatever way works best for you is the right way and the last thing that you should write down on your framework is how are you going to end your spell how are you going to ground the energy that's left and come back to an equilibrium and how are you going to close and this is back to that phrase you can choose a phrase like so mote it be or you can choose you know by my will is one that I like to stay cuz it feels powerful some  closing remarks over but I like to have a formal phrase it should be easy and it should be easy to remember because of the more you do it the more second nature it becomes and you'll be able to close out a spell and ground just by saying your phrase it'll become that easy for you like she'll talk about sometimes raising energy sometimes you can just do that just feel that energy rush into you it's because we've done it so often by Raze energy for spells so many times that is second nature now you can just feel it gather it and know that it's ready to direct at a moment's notice and it's because you do the same things over and over again no Layla one of the things I remember the most about doing ritual during this stuff all over everywhere  don't care she's walking in mud and in the Snow Well yeah if I have socks on but yeah just something simple and but I just had him call me I might have your feet on the ground like that physical literal grounding is what I always remember you perfectly without his Pomp and Circumstance on the ground do you remember in our community after a large working after a large ritual what they would very often do okay so in our old Community we had people that were brand-new we very often had people that that was  very first time they have ever been to a real school and then we had people who had been at their whole entire lives decades and decades and decades so we had people on all at so things were kept pretty literal a lot of times in these rituals and what I remember very clearly is at the end of every ritual they would literally have people after the cone of power was raised and the circle was released people would literally dropped to all fours or lay down on the ground and we would talk about letting that energy ground literally into the Earth you know come back to an equilibrium there's like one of my favorite and so you would literally acted out you yourself would go down to the ground as you felt this energy release into the Earth and come back to a nice balance and it was just a very nice physical way literal representation and so you can do that you can walk outside in your bare feet go touch grass it's good for you or you can do  in a representational way whatever works for you you know if you're envisioning a waterfall going down over you and down into the ground to bring you back to Center but whatever you need to do it again we'll talk about this more next episode but whatever you need to do to release any excess energy and come back to a balanced equilibrium episode okay you guys are going to have to be in suspense till next week so now you've got your framework you've written it all down hopefully in your book of shadows now it's time to actually do the spell this is the fun part when you begin your spousal I feel but it's best to start by creating Sacred Space and whatever way works for you and this is also another part that I think should be ritualize but should be the same as much as possible so that your magical brain knows so it's Bell time it's ritual time you know it has that trigger like Pavlov's dog you've trained your brain to know when it's time to do so  so should always be the same my my anal retentive self back in the day I never did spell work without casting a circle I don't know why I felt like I needed to that's what we were taught that you create Sacred Space and to create that Sacred Space Wherever You Are You cast The Circle I just I never did a spell it out casting a circle whereas I would say that's necessarily the case now but it's because I can do it so second nature and right off the cuff and you know 30 years ago I couldn't get into Alpha and 1.2 seconds now I can't you know so I'm in a different place I don't think either is right or wrong but I do think that if you are newer there's something to be said for doing that because it creates a framework you know like we always say  and do these things just in an instant as second nature on your brain to know when it's time to do magic and that will allow you to get into that magical space faster and more powerfully every time so set your space do you always do ritual in front of an alter do you always Do It Outdoors but take a space that makes you feel magical and set it up to be even more magical and even more focused on whatever your intent is change the colors change the sense like we said in the last episode from you know Mr allister Crowley everything should put the magician's mind towards your intent after space vulture and started from scratch the altar matched or set up a brand-new altar in a different spot whatever works best if you're going to be doing love magic Romance  magic with your partner maybe you want to go set up an ulcer on your bed or on your nightstand you know that kind of thing so I got your space wherever it happens to fit best for your spell if space is lacking you know use what you got that's fine. Yeah and if you're sitting on your couch you know put some candles there maybe put a throw blanket or pillow that are in the colors that match with your intent you can still set your space even if you don't have a full-on witchy office so after you such a space maybe you've cast your circle another thing we used to do that we don't do anymore so much is I really felt I needed a representation of every element and I still kind of do that but it's not as hard and fast as it used to be you know I still kind of do that to not going to lie that goes right back to the whole week in DNA thing is freakish about what I have like if I don't have a feather in the east  but yeah I know I'm totally with you on the elemental representation because when you're asking the universe asking all the elements I look at it and you know that I look at the universe is made of all these elements I'm asking I'm asking everybody let's our framework are magical system tends to DNA your magical system might be very different maybe you're coming from a very Celtic framework of folk magic or root work or Greek or whatever your magical system is it might look different so this is where you're going to set things up to match what your system looks like how do you get into magical space this is where you're going to start to do that set your magical space however that works for you and then you're going to introduce the idea of a spell this is so now you're in your magical space and go down your list State your intention this is why I'm  here and start to ask your items or bring in your items to that spell in whatever way you've chosen so now you bring these in and now you're saying your words and your doing the actions that you've chosen in your framework you know you basically you kind of make this quote on quote list prior and now that you've got your list gathered now you're going to start doing the things are you okay now it's time to talk to the you know I have a conversation about your intentions with them and then burn them or you know prior to or you just light it up in symbols what are you doing with your candles are you going to start or what are you doing with the Stones it's time to do that so now is the time to act on all of the points on your list most spells are based around sympathetic magic just like correspondence  the actions that you perform in your spell are a symbolic representation of what you want to happen in the world what your intention is so use your imagination and your intuition to create a spell that looks like what you want a symbolic act you want romance your spell could be you and anointing yourself with sensual oils while changing a love poem you know when I make it back in and gestures to call in a lover you want prophetic streams create a pillow you don't get it sweet dreams pillows and fill it with streaming and all your tools your action should all be and everything should work together for like a recipe or play everything should work together and Slow and Low together nicely and it's okay if you need to stop and look at your notes it's okay if you need to grab a book I've literally done it with the notes right there before and I mean  he talked in a long time ago either even recently I've done it with the notes right there do I like it better and do I feel more powerful like the spell feels better if I'm able to kind of get into a flow and just let it work yes but can I still make it work if I have to kind of stopped that magical energy and losing so I feel like once you have done all these things to you know like you said it's kind of your left with now you raise your energy you ground your energy then you can wrap it up with that so thank the items that you asked and thank the items that you worked with thank the deities or energies that you brought beer grateful which everybody know that's good job well done everybody thanks team wrap that up and then and you're still there and again repetition and in doing these things in a in a way  is familiar can build that power and can make it so much easier for you to slip into magical space and do the Spells and I think that that's where a lot of the meditative work and you know store strike me down the journaling comes into play one thing I do like this I like those spells that are like you know like a seven-day spell our 5-day spell cuz I feel like that gives you time to create that repetitiveness but when it comes to doing things over and over again everybody wants to be that head witch in the forest that has been doing this for 100 years you know what the hedgewitch in the forested practice practice practice practice field silly in the beginning Until you realize that practice is getting you somewhere  practice and that's because you do an awful lot of it a lot of what you feel you want and need create your framework follow your framework raise the energy send you can't go wrong I don't think the basis of a lot of spells comes down to correspond how can you use your imagination to best represent with the items that you have the goal that you want to achieve you use what you have and you can draw correspondences between pretty much anything so no matter what you have you can find a correspondence probably that works for you but that also works for the steps of your spell the reason why that candle cord-cutting spell is so popular is because somebody came up with the idea that two people cutting a cord and having the Flames looks like toucan  leather cord wrapped around you know so just come up with what you want to do and think of a way to represent that visually with the things that you have and you know again I want to just make sure we touch on the fact that if you have nothing your spell can be equally as effective maybe all you have is you and your mind and your voice you can call in the elements call India calling the elements of the powers of financial gain or the powers of love the powers of peace and serenity and in used to the idea of your spouse to then turn back to the universe so as much as all the corresponding tools and and stuff is all wonderful and pretty and smelly good if you have nothing you do always have your voice in your intention it's just kind of hard the only thing that the thing to do for you is help get you into the match  space easier they help you to raise the proper energy easier they lend their energy to your working so you don't need them you just can make it a lot easier for you that's why I love Stones cuz I feel the MMA energy like so easily compared to other things really start to have energies of their own I was almost going to say their own personality but kind and so sometimes items that you work with feelings and correspondences that might vary wildly from anything else that you know or understand but that's a little different will have to chat on a different episode about how my malachite definitely has a mind of its own yeah and I have a Tarot deck they hated me and everyone actually know there was one person that likes I remember you gave it to that person that's true you're exactly right I did  you were doing those workshops at universities yeah I would actually love to hate you to go to the young person that went to Binghamton back in 1999 fish dish that was given it to her if you're listening updates on the status of you and the decks relationship we need to allow that would be really really funny and I doubt it would ever happen but that wasn't really funny I was just seeing if you got any mail  sure and I'll believe you anyway all right so next episode next week we will doing our third and final episode in the series on raising energy how do you raise energy to power spells what's a cone of power we're going to need to talk about this is absolutely so thank you so much for listening to this episode of back on the broomstick please give us some like some stars and reviews it really helps the show that helps people find us a little witches well I think I need to go Journal Layla I mean write in my book of shadows next episode so let's talk about raising energy part 3 will see you there being wise be Wicked and keep it with she folks

----------------------------------------
welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and this is part one of our three-part series on spellcrafting in this episode we talk about Spell components and correspondences what do you need what they mean and why are they part of spellcraft and I'm show and I am so excited because I think that this is going to be super fun we're going to talk about correspondences and associations and what all these charts mean that you find online and in books and I'm just really ready to get to the nitty-gritty of magic this is one of my favorite parts of magic is creating spells and finding all the ingredients and everything to put together for it I have a lot of fun with this it's very crafty recipe like to me that kitchen witch feel even though it's not necessarily kitchen witchery per se but it's kind of got that let me find the meaning of this and this is like a recipe you see it all the time  discussion boards all over the internet people are wondering what spells do you use what do you use for this spell or that type of spell and people like to follow what they see on Tik-Tok or YouTube but a lot of times they don't know how to adapt it to themselves or they don't know why they're using the different ingredients that they're using the flip side of that you know we get questions on our discussion group via email in person I have a specific intention what do I use and I think the issue with correspondence has four people initially is oh my God I have to memorize all this stuff and that's just not the case that's just not the case I think and it will get into this as we go that you need to adapt and you need to get that base knowledge and then turn it into your wisdom really what you need the most of his imagination  journaling but the reason for that is because correspondences are all about association's what does something do what does it correspond to you'll hear us say and other magical practitioner say it like for like magic or it's sometimes they'll even go very fancy and call it the doctrine of signatures  doctrine of signatures in like-for-like magic is pretty old the idea of using different ingredients in spellcraft and choosing them according to their properties has been used in many cultures around the world for thousands of years and we even have written evidence of people talking about different ways to use herbs and other items in like-for-like ways and you know that that kind of goes back to you know my little anecdote about kitchen witchery you know it's almost like following a recipe per say if you want a vanilla pudding these are the ingredients you need to add to get a vanilla pudding you know if you need a Prosperity spell these are some ingredients you might want to consider to use for that Prosperity spell so I kind of look at them almost maybe that's just kind of how I compartmentalize it in my head is like almost like recipes not baking recipes because baking recipes have to be very exact so maybe think of those more like eyemed  but most of this is a good healthy recipe and I'm glad you said it the way you did because sometimes I might add a pinch of this 4-2 that and that's where I go astray from sometimes traditional listing as whether it be books internet list what have you because sometimes it feels right to add a little black pepper even though the book doesn't say so what we're talking about is the ingredients that you're going to use in your spellcraft what do you choose what herbs do you choose to make your incense what color candles do you use do you use a candle what other items might you put in the spell what type of stone type of symbols and how do you choose them we're going to talk about all of those things and why you would do that as well and you'll hear she'll say a lot intention intention  and people that are full on intention know that you don't technically need any items or ingredients to cast a spell exactly having them there is definitely a big part of helping you to get into your magical frame of mind especially if you're not someone who has done this repeatedly where you can just put yourself into an alpha State and it and just bought a spell with intention and energy most people need more than that just at the stage so to speak and just as much as you Harper on journaling iHeart for an intention to Step One really needs to be what is your intention with your speller you're working because that's what's really going to determine where you Branch out quote-unquote materials Wise from there so you have to think of what is the whole purpose of what I'm doing what am I trying to accomplish and then probably the next step is  going to be how elaborate I guess it's the best way to get for me to put it and by that I mean am I just throwing together a couple of things I have handy or do I need to go to the store and what these ingredients do for you and do for your spell work is get you into a magical frame of mine it's set and setting they have to set everything up for you so that your magic can be at its most potent so that your intention can be at its most pure and your spell can be of most power you are basically getting all of your senses in alignment with your intention you're using everything that you have all senses you use smells site textures you're using sound all of these things to put you in the frame of mind for a money spell or just a spell or a love spell the way you layer and set your area your altar and your spelling gredients is going to put your mind into a certain mindset and that will help to empower your spell and then  also did you know some of the things you may need to use could be determined on what type of spell you're looking to do we talked in a couple previous episodes I like to burn things so obviously if I'm doing something I can do is going to be one of the color and the way you choose those things is going to be by symbolism we talked about like for like magic and a doctrine of signatures and what that is goes back to 65 see a Roman dude named Gaius Cortese he basically wrote about medicine in Rome and he said that herb that plants the way that they looked they did medicinally Heroes of the herbs Scorpius resembled a scorpion's tail and so that meant that this herb would help with a scorpion sting  interesting Theory now this goes on to later in the 1400s this other guy now he's spun a philosopher named philippus aureolus theophrastus bombastus Von hohenheim thank you for not asking me  even more interesting he gave himself the name paracelsus easier to say so paracelsus he was born in the 1400s he was an alchemist and astrologer and philosopher and he believed that a person was more than just their body that they were Body Soul and a spirit that connected you to the universe and he believed that healing should be both physical and spiritual so we had a lot of cool ideas but he was also someone who believed in the idea of like for like magic and he coined the principle of some of its current or like yours like you're saying a lot of the last one is Jacob bomb and he was born in 1575 and he was a cobbler actually and he had a mystical Vision when he was about 25 years old and he claims to know the relationship between man and God and he talked about the doctrine of signatures in a book that was called the signature of all things published in 1621 and he said  when God created all objects he marked them with a signature that showed what their purpose was and so this concept that the Divine has given everything a clue to its you mix up the doctrine of signatures is very animistic it's very much everything is connected like take the Scorpion weed that the original Roman dude talked about right there look like a scorpion's tail comb actual plant in the Mediterranean and it's seed pod looks like the spiral Corkscrew of a scorpion's tail it will not cure you from a scorpion sting right but it does have anti-inflammatory properties it does have wound healing properties so it's not exactly true medicinally but the concept is sound very animistic in nature and that's where we get the idea of like for like magic because maybe they can't physically do this thing but magically this idea that what it looks like what it does wear it come  from the color of it how it makes you feel all of these things contribute to what it does in the magical realm there are a lot of different people just sick of herbs or colors or candles of correspondences I just want a listing of of things that you could use in your correspondence table because as much as I poke fun at Layla and her journaling I will say that one of the first things I did back in 19 was created my own correspondent stables in a book of shadows or Journal because I figured that was kind of the basis for my magical working was kinda to start getting familiar with you know what do I use this for what does this mean what does it symbolize what energies are emanating from this one of the absolute  things to use a book of shadows for is your own personal correspondences I had Cunningham's herbal encyclopedia you know I had a book of those books at Krystal's but I needed that kind of compacted 15 books should I kind of formed my own quote unquote magical meanings and magical correspondences for things was experimenting with Angus writing things down creating my own and you know it's not going to be just you know herbs and crystals and candles and colors remember things like metals and days of the week have correspondence flowers have correspondence his numbers have correspondences items like acorns and keys and pencils and animals and all things have a core everything every item has  when you're doing the journaling I have several questions that you should ask yourself with the item what do you personally feel know or think about the item write those things down what does it make you feel what do you know about it then write down what is the most common or most well-known idea about it what is it saying books about it what if you heard about it would have other people said about it then the last thing that you should look at is how is this item this tree this object this moon phase whatever it is how is it shown in history and stories and in folklore you know what do you know about the use of lemon in folklore what have you ever heard about anything you know their stories about people using willow switches or you know what have you heard about these objects when what can you find out in history because a lot of times that is what will give you the basis of what it does magically I want to interject with an example  or I feel like we live in a divided world over this particular topic I am going to bring it up I forever and a day have felt that an ass or sword represents fire and I know we had this conversation as it relates to Terro but I'm also talking in a magical correspondence way and I know that there is a portion of the magical community that view that as an air sign I think that that is a key example of ghetto take what you find in these tables but what does it mean to you what are you getting from this object or from this this particular plant or animal what have you what are you getting out of it because there are a big group of people who get air Vibes out of swords and in Athens  and the reason for those differences in the magical correspondence is because of a difference in how it's viewed people who say stores are representative of air say that is because of Blade's Edge cuts through are they talk about the phrase of intellect being sharp and the air is the element of mind and thought And Then There Are People Like Us who say that swords are representative of fire because swords are forged in Fire and that becomes part of their nature they also say that stores are used in combat and combat is Mars fire angry energy my point is that when you describe an object when you personally write down all the descriptive words of what an object is and does the characteristics that you find important enough to mention are the magical correspondences of that item to you so definitely write your own feelings in your own correspondence his first and then write the known correspondences and Mark which one's feel correct  to you and feel like they work to you and work with the ones that you're not sure about and see how that fits and you know I think creating your own table is a good way to keep it organized for future use because I still to this day frequently go back to some of my correspondence tables because you know that is a lot to to keep in your in your little head when you're got a lot going on in life and having your own notes about that and I'm I'm not negating book buying but having your own notes in your own journal thought your own feelings on these things are going to make spell work become like secondhand nature because instead of being like okay so I want to do a spell for inner strength and Clarity but now I got to spend a couple days figuring out what I need to do use you're going to get to a point where you like you know what I need to work on some Inner Strength I'm going to pull this candle  this this Stone in or just going to put it all together and it's going to be second nature to you specifically to you is that depending on what culture you're from they might have a slightly different meaning there are a lot of things that are archetypes and we'll get into those in a second but some things like they say the color white and United States of America white is a very traditional wedding color and it is in other cultures as well but in some countries like China and some African countries white as a color of mourning very different meaning the color pink used to be like right now it's pink for girls blue for boys right it used to be pink was considered a masculine color it was just maybe for boys because it was a diluted form of red it was considered too powerful and spiry because it was associated with Mars and blood and dangerous it was too powerful for girls  and blue eyes like the sky area and saw it and was associated with the planet Venus so blue was for girls so again depending on what culture you come from what time. You come from different things will have different associations and that's okay but you need to know when those associations are ingrained in you and and what it feels like to you there are some things that seem to be very Universal symbols we know that symbols can get into our subconscious in a very strong way because some of these are our Universal around the world like circles almost always represent bonus or a woman's belly it represents no beginning and no end they have a lot of the same representations Frost Road exactly the idea of the universal mother is an archetype the trickster is a universal archetype  far from Union psychology and the idea is that there are some symbols and ideas that are Universal that all people everywhere at all times will recognize yeah no matter where you go you kind of recognize these now some that aren't quite so Universal but are still very easily recognized our say Santa Claus Santa Claus is an archetype a lot of things will have an archetypal correspondence as well that'll be just kind of an innate idea and some you can just put on it yourself like she'll side with those sword being fire instead of air depending on who you are that will make a big difference in our old Community almost every single time someone called fire they use the same and that community in that space it was coming but in other communities swords might be are so really depends on where you are you know to give an example of how archetype scan kind of play in to spell work  I want to do a love spell I may grab a I'm a bird a pink or red candle and I may use summer all pieces and portions of rows and more often than not the roses that I tend to use my car either a light red or a dark pinkish color so you see my same here I'm doing a love spell and I got this red pinky thing going on witch in our Collective Minds again you know red hearts red is love a red is romance so you know even sometimes you don't feel like it's kind of that archetype it is and you can add to that you know in our culture pink and flowers and hearts and roses are all love related are all romance related you can take that one step further what's romance related to you maybe if your lovers cologne maybe it's  specific foods that you like to eat together maybe you only wear silk when you're with them and so those things now have to do with romance and sensuality because those other associations that you have given them on top of what they already have and so you can bring those into your spell as well. I did a nice little romance see things for me and the sweetums I put a little splash to the Dior sauvage in their jackets back into the idea of layering your space layering your spell with all the things to get every part of you focused on your intention Aleister Crowley one of the best books okay I save best but only if you're really a masochist it's Aleister Crowley I mean really but his book 777 and other qabalistic writings he has a lot of  correspondences there are a lot of tables and that's where a lot of these ideas come from and he says in that book quote since the student is a man surrounded by material objects if it be his wished Master one particular idea you must make every material object about him directly suggest that idea in the ritual quoted if his glance fall upon the lights their number suggests Mercury you smells the perfumes and again Mercury is brought to his mind in other words the whole magical apparatus and ritual is a complex system of mnemonics and quote and mnemonics are our Memory aids are things to Aid you in your magic to bring to your mind to your senses all the things that remind you of your purpose your intent and give power to your spell some wise words you know yeah he wasn't always crazy sometimes he said some cool ship  in the end of Mystic idea all of these objects want to help you you're asking them to Aid you in your spell work in your magic and so you want all of them to be of the same mindset I guess and that's like you were saying show with the different pink things in the flowers and bringing all things that have the same purpose as soon as gold together if you were going to write a money spell what types of things just off the top of your head would you throw in it and I'm cheating cuz I'm looking at my money Bowl so I would put in rice because that is a traditional symbol of money and a lot of cultures plus I love rice cinnamon again also used to be very pricey spice and it is fiery at lights a fire under your ass when you're lazy you need to get out there and make some money if that hustle going I also like to put in an interesting money and here's where my correspondence  how many people will feed their money bowls with actual money and I like mine to be real money fake money will work as well again as long as that fits that Vibe it gives you that intention of real money that works but I like to use interesting money so I have like a $2 bill and a really old $1 silver certificate cuz they're interesting and different and I want my money to be interesting and different I have my British coins in mine I hear you and I also like to have star anise in there because I like the star and the idea of you know shooting for the stars and and again that is a slightly different correspondence star anise might not be something you normally see in a money spell but because it makes me think of reaching for the Stars it's in there for me since you had to bring up the whole Moneyball thing and then I'm going to circle back to buy I asked I actually have one of these cowrie shell in here  because there used to be back in the old days tribes that would use these calorie shelves as a form of currency is opposed to our traditional modern-day metal one paper coins in dollars and cowrie shells are also a great example of the doctrine of signatures because cowrie shells were used in African Traditions not only as money but also as a fertility charm because they look like a Volva and then I'm all about color correspondences so I have to greet adventuring stones in here just because they're green I also have acorns because remember that day when we were at Central New York Pagan Pride day there had to be 10 trillion billion acorns on the ground when I think of acorns I think of abundance and in things being plentiful I go back to that day that we were at that Park and it was just  everywhere so I think of that is kind of a prosperous thing so you might not find it in a traditional correspondence but that's kind of a weird shelf because from a small seed on Mighty Oak grows so if you want to grow an idea grow a business grow your money in your savings account using coins know what I wanted to ask you was was there a particular day of the week that you would do this and why I don't stay at the beginning of the year it's kind of like one of my New Year's traditions so I don't pick up reticular day but I do have a time of year I guess that I like to do it and the reason I came to the point I wanted to make is that everybody has their own way and there's nothing wrong you know like you would like to do your money bowl at the beginning of the year some people refresh at weekly  start wanting to get on monthly I don't necessarily follow correspondences of days of the week maybe I should but I don't currently but I do need to follow the moon phase correspondences void of course but yeah so there's certain thing as you know like I will always pick certain things like an herb in a stone and then everything from after Urban stone is kind of a crapshoot depending on what I have available my mood what's going on in my life at that particular point and how much time I have so there's no wrong way and it's not that you have to pick something from every group  it's more layering your space it's more layering in these items that are going to help you this is your team you're assembling your team right now your clothes out of your toolbox trying to get everybody together you're letting them know what their position is what their part to play in this whole thing is and they're enthusiastically ready to go they're going to lend you their energy like a football huddle exactly what energy are they lending you ask them so you're going to do a spell for me Justice say somebody at work has wronged you or whatever you need a little Justice in your life until you can start with Santi di here here is a God of Justice you could start there what things does tier like you could start Gathering those things you could go with a Libra you could be bruh the scales of Justice right what things are associated with Libra you can start to gather those things together what do you associate with Justice  is it a bad is it handcuffs maybe write down what you want to see bring all these things together that say justice to you and have that in your environment you could even set yourself up for those things where something maybe that makes you feel like a lawyer or is it makes you feel like a judge the superhero I don't know makes you feel like you're going to bring this justice but layer everything so that's the whole idea is you want your space and everything around you to be focused on your intent and I have to go back to the stones and crystals to be like all right these for associated with Justice and truth let's do this thing is is that it says that purpose to you if your purpose is money the object the herb the stone needs to save money to you and this is where don't ever bring this up again okay  but this is where is a hundred and 10% agree with you on the journaling or like a science project you do you want to write down okay so I use the Black Candle and I used valerian root and I rub some eucalyptus on my can you do you want to write these things down because if this ends up working for you you want to let you know repeat and he was this necessary and if it doesn't work for you you want to be able to say okay what can I adjust and maybe what can I use more of less of change out for something else next time so you really want to kind of keep track of this for the sake of did it work did it not work from here for the next time a hundred percent  and once you do have those correspondences and they are working for you don't let anyone tell you that you're doing it wrong because as long as it works for you it doesn't matter what they say you're still working out there's exactly to add two shells example of the sword being for fire many many moons ago when I first met witches in Salem for Salin I became friends with them and I was able to visit them and there were two different covens in Connecticut and I was lucky enough to work with them a little bit which was really really cool and one of the rituals that we did I was asked to call West and as a little witchling I was super honored and super scared because here are these big powerful third-degree witches who've been doing this shit for so long and they have titles and hereditary shift going back now they could trace their lineage  yeah I was very intimidated but hey I get to call Wes so yay Bluewater West I'm good right so in the center of the circle is a big circular table there is all sorts of different items on it they started in the East and the person would reach to the table and East pulled up in sense and did their call South there was I think it was a candle I don't remember I'd suspect then it came to me I saw no chalice I saw no she'll just what's going on here I've done nothing blue I didn't know I was supposed to have an object I didn't have anything ready I did see a stick and the stick was Forks on one end like a dowsing Rod so I picked it up and held it as a dowsing rod and called West and boy did I feel that energy run right up my arms I can almost feel it now  thinking about it it was wonderful it works great I was so proud of myself as I got this is perfect good job no that was not to be at the end of the ritual I was pulled aside by The High Priestess and her high priest I can't remember her name but it was a coven of fire and snow just saying they pulled me aside  I did it wrong I did not use a chalice or a shell I use the stick and how dare I and that was so wrong and so bad and they are going to tell me why it was so wrong and I've been typed up hey that was in Rod calling water bubble made total sense did you not feel the energy and I did have quite a few of the other of the coven who heard this back me up energy was great they knew the dowsing Rod reference even the ones who didn't and still felt the energy were like oh that's why it works so don't ever let anyone tell you that your correspondences are wrong if it works it works all it needs to do is get your magical brain activated that you and magical space to raise the energy and to do that spell and that's what counts and that's why you have to write it down  I would have accepted my you know my shame and you're lashing your traditions and covens around the land that they have a certain way about things and that you have to respect that you know if you are going to to be a part of a tradition or be a part of a coven are a group that to them you know Bluewater West and there's no no talking about anything you know you have to go with that or maybe that's not the group for you you don't have to follow along with traditional meanings but you also have to be respectful that people do have their own version of what these things mean to them and maybe you'll learn it that way like who's to say that we associate stores with fire because that's what our community did and that's what we did  for years and years and years and rarely did it any other way so who's to say that that wasn't formed because of that community and that's okay you know that's that's what tradition is for that's what culture and Community is forced to teach these things in the past month if it didn't feel right we wouldn't continue to do it and there are some things that you will ask them you know say you're doing a love spell and you reach for sulfur it might tell you no no I don't really want to be in this Louis though I don't want to be a part of your bullshit man right this isn't exactly the right energy you want to bring to that love spell it right and you're not sure why maybe it's because you know so there can be correspondences they are even if the traditional meaning might look a little different I think we're really most recently about how correspondence  I mean different things to different people is taking it back to our episode on Charmed cast I have since that time collected a vast amount of little trinkets from a little charm bag there are signals that they made me and something in particular to me but are going to have a completely opposite meaning to you or the next guy or the lady down the street because those charms were picked because they either reminded me of something in particular made me feel a certain way trigger to certain thought or memory and you're not going to have that same thought that same feeling so I think the charm bag really kind of put it in the Forefront that correspondences are so individualized and yes please buy the books read the tables follow the charts but also use your own  intuition because if you don't trust your intuition where the hell yeah yeah and it and it's so much easier than you think you already have a list of ideas about everything you already have a list of ideas and feelings about every color and about gems and about plants and about objects in your house all you have to do is name them that's that's why I shall stay and put it in a journal have to keep pointing that out because sometimes you don't know what those connections you have in your brain are until you write it down till you say it out loud so next time you do a spell don't look one up ask yourself what do I associate with look what do I associate with success and then start to gather those things and bring them together and then put your spell together if you want to go look it up go look up what you wrote down and see you know hey this is what I felt and thought what is the quote on  call Textbook correspondences and how do they cross paths at all at all or am I just totally different than what these tables are saying use your imagination use your feelings let it just let it go let any preconceived ideas go and just go with what your gut says and what you're feeling say you are basically creating order out of chaos you're creating a system to get you closer to your intended result so everything that you can bring in that matches that intended result was going to make your spell more powerful so just start grabbing those things that match that idea and bring them into you and then write your spell from there you'll be very surprised at how well that works was a wonderful part 1 because we do have a part 2 and part 3 so Layla give him a little heads up on what to expect for part 2 of a spell working and I always talked about how to gather your items for the spell next we're going to talk about how to  put them all together how to actually write the spell from start to finish you've gathered the things that you want you've layered all of these feelings and ideas to help you get into that magical headspace now what exactly the next episode of Abby now what how to write that spell and then the third one after that will be had a power to spell times get your supplies and we're going to talk about craft in your spell so thank you all so much for listening to this episode of back on the broomstick and we really hope that you're not offended that I see swords is fire  join us next week for part two of our spell draft summer series and in the meantime stay wise say Wicked keep drooling and keep it with Chi

----------------------------------------
welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and this is another episode in our quest for a powerful spell craft summer beaches in bikinis have a Carefree Vibe but that's certainly not the feeling of this summer so we're looking for something with a little more sex appeal and by that I mean boundary spells and baneful magick because nothing says it's stress-free summer like energetically evicting toxic people from your life and reclaiming your piece one curse at a time and I'm sure she'll and I think the best thing I've heard all day is energy ejection AJ that's right you know I wanted to definitely bring this to folks attention because we're living in some crazy times and we need some boundaries set and you know sometimes it's hard right now to find a safe spot for yourself and your being and so what we want to kind of help you create a safe space for yourself and and kind of give that back off  to those who need it and with the Itchy ass hole spell being as popular as it is we also want to give you know those who needed a little extra each this summer magic can be use to help you clean your piece magic can be used to help you have a stress-free life and sometimes to keep your peace you might need to do a little bit of baneful magick may be a little hex maybe a little curse As a treat sometimes you need to set those boundaries in a very powerful and strong way now let's talk a minute because there's going to be folks that are going to go my gosh you can't do that so let's talk a minute let's talk about the rule of three people will bring up the wiccan rule of three or the law 3 or sometimes those talk about Karma no I just want to point out something that you just said that that may just kind of fly over people but the  he is really kind of a Wiccan thing so I think the biggest thing I want to point out first and foremost is folks that are Wiccan don't necessarily follow the rule of three cuz it's a weekend thing that's right at the wiccan rede is a verse it was written by Doreen Valiente in 1964 and it is eight words the wiccan rede fulfill and it harm none do what you well and that it was written in a longer form by Lady gwenne Thompson in the early 70s this is been around for a little while and it's basically the idea that what you do for bad will come back to you 3 or 10 times as strong it's kind of loosely based on the idea of Karma and you know like the boomerang effect but I got to stay Leila there are times where I am okay with what comes back around absolutely and I don't necessarily believe in the rule of three we  I'm done an episode on this we both do believe that what goes around comes around and that for you know I might not believe in the rule of three but I do believe in Newton's third law hahaha which is for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction that's mess science thank you very much and I do believe that that applies in Magic and just like in science it's not exactly a hundred percent true because there's things that will affect that there's friction there's gravity those Mass things will prevent it from being equal and opposite same thing is true and Magic there are things that will prevent your spell going out from having an equal and opposite Boomerang effect fate towards their magic your magic the time of day the time of the year there's all sorts of things that could prevent that well let's talk for a second about what what would you tell I I've got my own answer but what would you tell someone who says but does that make me a bad person or bad witch it was a naive  for setting boundaries hell no setting boundaries is important taking care of yourself will tell you to set boundaries protecting yourself is important and I very strongly believe that if someone hurts you you have every right to handle that shit in any way you see fit or you know I also apply that rules to my children oh yeah absolutely people that I love if someone comes at you you do not need to turn the other cheek that is not always the right response you don't want to see the other Gemini side of me and while I am very much I go along and get along with their our line and the people yeah and you do need to process your anger you do need to process your heart and people do need to get in trouble for what they have done and sometimes that involves making sure that they get what they deserve and just like when you punch somebody in the face or someone punches you and your face Justice isn't always linear and it's not always perfect but we work with what we say  we're just staying going around on Facebook and I love it so much have the days that you deserve that is a beautiful hacks I love that and if you deserve great you get if you deserve shit you are getting a heaping pile a steamy shit in a lot of the magic that we're going to talk about is Magic that is definitely fueled by the recipient by the recipients actions curses and hexes part of their power comes in the belief of them by the recipient part of their power also comes from the actions of the recipient a lot of these are sour jars or mirror spells or have the day that you deserve spell which is like a mirror spell it basically bouncing their own energy back to them so they really do kind of get what they give out absolutely and you know just because you are are setting boundaries and creating kind of a safe little bubble for yourself that doesn't make you a bad person  and putting it out to the universe that you want someone to get what they're putting out back that's not making you a bad person because you're just asking for them to get what they are putting out if they're putting out some shine and Roses they're going to get that all day long it's up to them what they get back and if you have been wrong then you decide you need to be the dark goddess of Revenge and Vengeance rock on with your bad self man that's fine if that happens to sometimes that's necessary now most of the time again hexes and curses the way a lot of practitioners will use them as more like we've said is boundary setting is protecting themselves and a lot of these are you know how they say look at an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure set up your protections and that's why you should kind of practice your Wars and protections even if you don't need them back to studying circles. Just setting boundaries practice talking to the energies around you for protection  Ashley when you don't need them cuz you need to learn to swim before you're drowning kind of thing exactly and you know I think I think one thing that I kind of like about this is this time of year especially with what's going on in the world right now especially you know we need to kind of all create our own little safe spaces and that's how we're going to stay sane through this all right so you said safe space and that kind of reminds me I have a little story for you oh my god Layla's making a left turn again I do it again you taught me well turns out what does this is on topic I promised many years ago my mother worked in an office that had one person in particular that was very disruptive to the whole group so this was a group of about 10/12 people who worked in one large room no walls are dividers or anything and it's one particular person cause everyone to have bad days regularly that talks  so my somewhat witchy mother came to me and said is there anything that you can think of that would help this person leave because she didn't want a promotion she didn't want to move job she loves where she was she had been there longer than anyone else and often said she would never leave that office so mom wanted to know anything we could do I said this is the perfect opportunity for some hot foot powder powder mostly comes from who do Andrew twerk its folk magic so you'll find it in all sorts of different American folk magic traditions and basically the idea with powder is to have somebody get up and go either they can't cross the hot foot powder to get to your house they just feel restless and need to leave or if you put it this is a type of foot track magic so you put it in where their feet go it will cause their feet to get hot and itchy and make them want to move along so I can buy in a little bit of hot foot powder with a little bit of Road opener it with the idea being  that this person needs to leave where they're at and go someplace else where they'll be happier when should you know there's nothing wrong with that perfectly fine you are not harming you are not putting any bad shit out to someone you just get up and move along my friend so this is still a hacks this is still light little curse but the idea is to bring peace and Harmony to the office so this worked what my mother did is with the help of other people in the office for 3 days before this person came in they sprinkled the hot foot powder under her desk where her feet go I loved your mother so much wouldn't you know it by the end of the third day at job was posted in another building and this woman was so excited the woman who vowed never to leave this office jumped at the chance to take this job in another building and got it and left now it works so well that people in the office decided to come and ask for more hot foot powder and of course I kept working  next person I believe it took about five days and their spouse got transferred military spouse got transferred across the country so they left as well so it worked beautifully work wonderfully I have a question that's killing everybody there any repercussions back 100% And I won't warn my mother of these consequences shortly after this happened I moved several hours away from my mother in the same state and then very quickly after that I moved across the country coincidence or consequence to what my mother was putting out the magic that she was putting out there do you know maybe there is consequences of the other point to this is also that just because something is a curse doesn't necessarily mean it's going to hurt someone there's no magic that you did or magic that she did to help someone move along to help someone not only help the office be more harmonious and peaceful but to also help  person find a place where they will fit in better and maybe they will find more peace and Harmony in their life with a ton of toxic people they didn't fall and Brilliant that's perfect so yeah so these types of magic doesn't always have to necessarily be painful and I think that's a good point because I think when people think of hexes and curses they're thinking some deep dark horse things that aren't necessarily the case you know like with with our summer spell that we're going to talk about this is really it's not about harming anybody when I tell you to harm anybody we want you to set boundaries so that no one harms you write some of these other types of magic that our boundary setting magic our findings and we'll talk about good and bad for binding freezer magic freezer spells that's a type of finding and I guess there are some people that would consider that to be a tie  text or a curse also spell jars and jars yeah you know you put some some broken glass to do this but I think it's important to talk about the consequences as well because there are times when the consequences they're worth it like let's just say for example that you ended up moving to California because of helping your mother with hot foot spell I hated it I was I was very angry but you moving to California for a few years was actually good for you and your family right exactly exactly so it might be hard mother and I  you're right back to me right back to the east coast now before you do any type of baneful magick any types of hex word even though the quote unquote less harmful kinds like I did with a hot foot spell for my mother you really need to do a lot of self-reflection you know a lot of times we do those quick hexes and curses without even thinking about it somebody steals your parking spot and may you have the day you deserve her may you step on a Lego or explode you know lying is a sin in some religions show  so we do those people do those little hexes and that's another good reason to have your Wars and your protections and then do regular cleansing cuz you know those little icky things accumulate even if they're not rational but if you're actually going to do a real working it requires reflection you need to know what you're doing you need to fully accept what you're doing and you need to be prepared to put out that type of energy so definitely start off any type of curse or baneful work figure out why why are you doing this another good point to make is these aren't the best things to do when you're at your peak of anger right if you are really upset and you are really angry and you are really hurt you need to take a moment take a step back maybe you need to meditate in Layla's famous words Journal but you don't want to be doing these things with a shit ton of anger in your heart because you're going to be the one receiving the bad end of that stick if you  you can be upset you can be hurt you can be angry but you don't want to be doing this when you're like at the height of those emotions or you're really not doing yourself any favors and will most likely be projecting that back on yourself unfortunately yeah and then you need to be brutally honest because there's been times in my life when I have been extremely angry and it was my own damn fault so you're pushing out there this bad energy and you're the one at fault you really want to be careful with that so calm down reflect be honest if you were going to do the spell out of pettiness out of Cruelty those are not the reasons to do a curse or baneful magick because then you are going to be the one at all to mately going to be directed back at and we keep saying that and I just want to point out that a lot of times yes that works and sometimes it doesn't because shit happens and the universe is weird and so sometimes you'll have bad  what happened to you for no fucking reason and sometimes bad people will have good shit happen to them for the same thing and we don't always get to control that so just understand it just like there's people in the world that we might want to do baneful magick against right now that aren't getting consequences for their actions sometimes no matter how hard you try magically bad people don't get consequences for their actions then you know I think I agree with that but I also think that everybody gets their karma in due time and it's not up to any one of us to decide when that dude time is so you know what if there is anybody out there in the world anything that's kind of orange the karma will come around Karma will come around but here's the other thing you don't want to focus all your time and attention on just doing baneful magick you know you can't you can't change the collective mind in my opinion  okay let's let's back up a second we've talked before about doing magic against large entities politicians insurance companies the mood whatever you're trying to do magic again weather magic is one that I like to use as an example have you ever taken any type of science class and heard like about friends like a storm front moving these huge masses of yeah I don't know the numbers off the top of my head but I learned that pushing those takes an incredible amount of energy to push a large wall of air is insanely difficult so people who say that they can do weather magic or either extremely extremely powerful or just getting lucky with their weather magic because being able to move something that large takes a lot of energy and so if you're going to spend all your energy trying to hex up politician or a person who has a cult behind them a cult of energy they have a ton of energy from people that like them appreciate them thank pause  hopefully about them that's very difficult to fight through your potion that train uphill right so you might better be putting your energy towards small things you your local place people around you you know your area put that magic put that energy into making those things better because you can very often have a much more powerful reaction and those collectively add up to very bigger reactions a hundred percent agree with you but I do also I just want to mention that I do also believe that let's say for example you were in a large group of witches which he minded people and you collectively as a group we're trying to do something then maybe but but I think we're specifically talking about individuals and please do it I mean if you want to throw your energy that way absolutely people should work towards what they want but I'm just saying that don't be surprised  can you put all this energy into it it doesn't work immediately because a lot of times there's other like we said earlier in the episode there's a lot of other forces that you have to think of think of it it with science there's friction is gravity is mass you got to worry about all of that isn't necessarily changing the collective or that old Ozzy Osbourne episode where he's trying to build a bonfire on the beach and the Tide's coming in and he's back ocean back you can't fight the tide sometimes as much as you might want to say I feel like I've argued with the ocean before so I totally get it and everyone needs to have their own argument with the ocean and succeed or fail and figure that out for yourself because there's some time when tilting against that windmill is 100% worth it to you absolutely just just remember that you know you are going to sometimes get back you know you're going to have the  you deserve as well and I think that just because you're doing any baneful magick or any type of hex work if it's warranted I wouldn't be so concerned about the boomerang effect because if you are coming from a place of pureness you're good man adding on the end if this comes back to me made it only come in wisdom and strength or something like that or me this energy me the energy I put out only returned in Beauty and power expecting everything to fit perfectly from the shoulders to the to the ways to the app so I can help I mean that intense can help build a little barrier around you it's certainly can but it's not the end-all be-all you should do before you cast baneful magick before you cast a curse or a hex what should you do what type of things should you do to cleanse or protect yourself or ready or space  now I definitely I feel like any magic that I do I just always kind of do that ground send you no ground Center cleanse I think it's almost kind of ingrained in me that's kind of a given for me but I think after that actually let me rephrase that is a precursor to that you have to decide what you're going to do how you're going to do it and gather your tools and materials and if I'm going to be doing something like a boundary setting spell or even the even a hot foot spa or something like that I'm going to ground Center cleanse my space and cast a circle because I like that little extra protection and it's part of my routine and ritual makes me feel protected and in a safe space now if I'm going to do a working I'm going to do a curse like if I'm going to do something serious I do more than that there have been times when we have done some pretty hefty magic together and the wards and things that we put up around the house first  solid right and I think that anytime I'm doing this kind of magic I always use mirrors and even if I'm not using mirrors in the spousal itself or the working itself as a like you said kind of creating my little container of space so I kind of like to set up that mirror type blockage to anything this coming at me go right back to you anything this coming at me go right back to you I'm rubber you're glue type of spell beautiful mirror spells and bounce off me and hit you spell are fabulous because part of that if it takes all the work out of it all you have to do is maintain your Wards maintain your mirrors around you and they do all the hard work but there was a time way back in the day were you and I did some very powerful baneful magick that was a different situation I literally sealed  I'm warded all of my windows my doorway is all of my pipes my TV I even worded everything as a conduit to come into your home and so because that was like a super serious someone was wrong in a family member of mine and and I I had to handle it so I went the extra step you know the salt on the windows I even did the the choc sigils over my doorways I guess what you're doing how you're doing and who you're trying to project it to May dictate how much you want to secure space another thing like you were talking about stealing your space and portals and that's goes back to the mirror thing if you're using mirrors intentionally in your spell any mirrors or reflective surfaces around you that are not part of the spell many people in many Traditions feel that those need to either be sealed like she'll did with a Sigil or award or literally covered so that  can't be a portal to come into you that that doesn't allow your magic to escape before you're ready it doesn't allow the spirit world to spy in on you can be a sign of respect for the spirit world for that liminal space some people also say that it's so that you're doing a baneful working you don't see your own shade while you're doing the working there such thing as I think people forget and I have such a funny story from literally yesterday I am now at a part-time job which is freaking Fabulous by the way I love it so much we're going to wait a little bit before we say we're so I'm I'm at my fabulous fabulous new part-time job yesterday and my boss comes in and he's like there's something really important you need to know and he's like this is the most important thing above all and you know I'm going through the litany in my head in my car at you know we need to keep things clean we need to vacuum you don't be polite to people no in the buildings at the  top is in there is like typing all through the ceilings and the boss said that the most important thing and he's going to die giggling when he hears this the most important thing is to keep the lid on the toilet closed so that things don't come in and and then talked about how he had all the piping warded and I'm just like you know even the shiter can bring you shit sometimes you know flowing water is actually a conduit for energy so that kind of makes sense so it is his biggest thing is keep the toilet lid closed because you don't know what I thought was freaking fabulous alright well in the vein of you know toilet cleansing magic let's talk about my favorite way to set up a ward my favorite way to practice award this is the soap bubble method  nope we're going to go we're going to go to the cleaning part we're going to go with soap bubbles so what I like to do my favorite way to practice warding and to make sure that it's strong enough is all about visualization they're going to find a comfortable spot and it's summertime so hopefully in your part of the world that means picnics and Outdoors and kids playing with soap bubbles cuz who doesn't love you know are south of southern hemisphere friends right now or like ready to curse us were talking about summer Pines and imagine a beautiful summer day and playing with soap bubbles and then picture one of those soap bubbles at your very center your solar plexus like a couple inches above your belly button and imagine that there is a beautiful perfect so far all right there once you have that picture in your mind whether you can see it or think about it or describe it make it get bigger make it get bigger and bigger and bigger until you're almost like Glinda the Good Witch inside this  and Crown let's not forget the crown so get the soap bubble that you're used to in the summer time and when you're sitting inside take a hammer I like to use mall near Thor's hammer from the outside and swing it against that so football and smack it and now it should ring like a bell and stay solid if it breaks or pops you have to start over again when I finish realize this cuz you would have done this for years when I usually has the hammer just bouncing off in the whole bubble going to leave I should not break and if it does break start over it at pops for any reason Friday yet if it did that's right and just keep doing that until you can hit it with a hammer and it doesn't break it might be easier to  just make it big enough to cover your body first and then gradually make it bigger and bigger and bigger so you can make it as large as a full 13-person coven Circle without breaking and that is a beautiful war that is a fantastic War to put up around yourself before you do any type of working or you don't want energy in or out right now once we've got ourselves kind of kind of kind of in that safe bubble then what years were the magic comes in here's where you do your actual work in the biggest part of that shells going to say what would you say the biggest part of a spell is I think it's both of us saying the same thing as slightly different way your energy your intention you have to say what you want and then you have to power it that's what we mean by intention and energy say what you want  push the power into it so what you're saying is there steps to this yes Step 1 create your safe space step to Heather your energy I swear you're going to make me start singing New Kids on the Block you got to stop with the steps or we're going to start singing new kids but there are when you're looking at the steps you want to have everything you need prepared and ready prior to creating your little soap bubble I'm so that once you're in your soap bubble now you are ready to kind of plot and plan how am I going to execute what I need to execute yes now for back to fuck off type spells for the spells to protect your peace and protect your boundaries the ingredients are surprisingly literal if you know what something does sympathetic magic will tell you what it does magically so that's why when you see sour jar  hotfoot spells and things that are designed to keep people away you'll see a scotch bonnet peppers Chili Peppers of all types you'll see garlic you'll see gross things bent Nails nasty Nails urine blood spit dirt bike stuff that's right because you don't want to be around Yucca stuff makes sense. That's why these things have all those nasty things in it because you want to repeal someone you want to repel their energy push it away another thing I like when I'm doing this type of magic I always like to use something and I know you talked about the rusty nails and in the broken glass but I always like to use some type of for lack of a better word at the moment I met a natural thing that's pointy whether it be stinging nettle or a rose thorns or whatever the case may be kind of like that in my mind it's like I use those things too  create like a prickly barrier around me so that you can't get close enough to me or you're getting stabbed yep that's why you'll see brick dust sometimes in these because that's part of building a barrier building that up so I love that you said Layla bit like your ingredients want to be the things that aren't necessarily enjoyable or I am you want these people to stay away give them every reason to not want to be around you right I love that you brought up a couple different types of things that poke and prick you because you're going to want to use different things depending on the reason for the spell if this is an ex-lover that you need to back off rose thorns if this is a friend or family member maybe you want to use metal something a little more familiar something a little more but you might use for healing or soothing with the you might think his to me Leo you know you kind of make those correspondence is and we'll have another episode where we talked about correspondences and things but that's very very important when it  comes too painful magic let you know I goes back to my famous last words your ingredients combined with your intention is going to equal your results so if you want someone to literally shut their mouths maybe you'll grab a cow's tongue and use that and you'll put sharp Pokey things in that or maybe you literally so it up I'll be honest with you I can't do that freaks me out I can't even look at it was weird though she'll might take a lemon so sour and sharp to cut it like a mouth on the lemon stuff it full of baneful things Pokey things and while she doesn't she'll stay anytime you speak against Me Maybe acid rise in your throat and may the word sting like Metals until stuff at all. It shut and as you so it should say me your lips be sealed as the skin is sealed and I'm buried in rotten fruit to I would I would also suggest rotten fruit as well that's an excellent thing again the idea is things that bush people  if you want them to get away from you but gross stuff in it keep them away now that I am I relocated to a more ocean environment I've also done a couple of things with writing something is on paper putting some intention into paper and then putting it in the water when I know we're on the brink of being pulled away from the coast and you've written something is on paper and put it in the water at that particular time and then have the ocean just pull it away from me I love that because that's another example of letting the mother take care of a problem for you you're basically saying hey Mom I have this issue could you please take care of it for me and so putting it in the water writing it on a lease and burying in the dirt depending on how you get rid of it is going to determine how it gets taken care of if you burn it you want something fast and quick and hot and Powerful you put it in the water you  but I'd seen that you wanted to go out and change and be transformed the same thing with burying it that's going to transform it slowly and maybe make it grow into something else so depending on how you get rid of it how you let them take care of it that Association lends itself to your spelling gives it a little bit of that energy to me ten years ago didn't trees I was told this recently that and I love this so much when you are using the restroom and you're having a moment to yourself in the restroom think about the fact that the person or the thing that you're looking to get rid of while you are handling your restroom business and then as you are using your toilet paper wipe that person away and then flush him I've seen where you write the person's name on the toilet paper before you  I was going to stay home tonight after I get him out of your life throwing them in the garbage throw the spell remnants in the garbage because that's where you want that person where that energy to go I so think of what you what it means for that correspondence Peterson more like protector space energy like putting someone in a freezer or finding someone in one of our episodes not too long ago she'll you said something that one of our listeners asked about and that was you said I don't want to be bound to everyone don't do a binding all the time because you don't want to be bound to the whole world that a little bit you know  never been big on binding spells because maybe it's just the way I think about it but I feel like it create something that I don't want to create it creates a tithe and I don't know why the hell would I bind you to myself if I'm trying to get rid of you was talking about is when we were taught about binding spells this goes back to consequences of your actions and consequences of magic now when you buying someone very often in the spell you were literally tying them in the Practical Magic uses I I bind you from harming yourself or others I find you whatever your name was from harming yourself or others and you're wrapping the cord around it and tying it there is a very strong belief and if it fits with the energetic magic with the sympathetic magic that when you tie a cord to find someone you're literally binding yourself your energy to that person so what shall means if you do a binding to prevent some  from harming or or whatever your binding them from or two I feel like I'm tying myself to that person you have now bound at least a little bit or a lot of bit of your energy to that person so you are now bound to them for good or for bad and in some way and so right and do a lot of witches won't do bindings for that reason unless it's really necessary we'll do some other type of magic to keep their energy separate and that's definitely how I feel because I have always been of the thought that why on Earth would I buy into believing a tiniest little piece of myself just freezer spells are similar because although you have Frozen them and stop them they're still in your freezer if you ever move or you need to clean out your freezer or you need a new freezer now you got to do something with them so that's not getting them out of your life as a friend of pausing things for a little bit to me or more for a pause when you need something to cool off when you need something to wait for Al  while while you would handle something else or get into a better place and then deal with it it's not a forever thing you have done for us on family because sometimes you like they're your family and you can't get rid of them but you need them just to shut the hell up so yeah I'm all for freezer spells on family but I also I wouldn't do for you to respond with some random people for the same thing I'm trying to get you don't get those things out of my life not keep them literally in my fridge yeah I tend to do freezers bells on certain family members every Thanksgiving and then I told him out after I've had to deal with them then I saw them out sometimes I don't even go to Thanksgiving the other one that I see a lot of people do is the candle cord-cutting spell which you know not really a fax or being full but it is protecting your peace Magic  but a lot of times they do it very much like a binding instead of cutting the cord and being done with it they obsess over it to themselves for longer that's right how did this burn what does it mean what does this wax mean why did it do this why did it do that everything has a mean and not everything happened because of whatever sometimes it just it is and more importantly when you cut the cord you're not supposed to obsess over the wise and the house and what does it mean you're supposed to cut it and be done and just get rid of it not think about it anymore that goes literally back to my whole thing out intention so if you are focusing like oh my God the wax looks like a bird or you know you're you're focusing so much on this cord cutting are you really cutting the cord you really binding it to yourself exactly so when you do these things be clear on your attention know exactly why you're doing it and make sure that what you're doing in the spell follows the intent  because of your intention is to do a cord cutting corn to be done with it but what you're doing in the spell is still thinking about them and talking about them and asking about them that's that's not really a court Friday so make sure that what you do in the spell make sense with your intention and I think that goes right back to you need to take that time prior and kind of reflect and in, there's from a place of clarity and not a place of hurt and out of place of anger or or what whatever this this is where you do with the whole meditate on it think about it you know virtually plan this out in your head before doing it so that you're not being contradictory in your magic and sometimes doing the spell can be a way to come to terms with those feelings maybe you have a lot of anger and fear and rage build up and you need to channel that energy in a better direction to heal yourself and to take care of yourself  so you can direct that into something you know say You're really upset over the way a court case turned out and you don't know what's going to happen at some issues at work what you really want this promotion your boss has a complete douchebag and is constantly on your case and you want them to back off for a little bit until this promotion goes through so maybe you make a puppet of this person they're constantly on your case they're mean to you they say belittling things you and you really need them to back off so you make a puppet of this person and you channel into that pocket all of your anger with them all of your frustration maybe you stay to them all the things that you can't stay at work and tell them to back off and leave you alone and then pin their hands together cover their mouth with a little bit of tape so that they can't talk against you I was literally just thinking duct tape duct tape their feet so that they can't walk across your path and cause problems put all of  anger and that energy into that say what you need to say get it all out and then throw it into the garbage which is where their negative influence over you belongs in the garbage away from you that can help you keep the boundary that can help you keep your peace at work and that can help you put up a wall between you and that person to try and prevent their energy from affecting your energy and doing that can also help you from not obsessing over the issue and being counterproductive to your spouse exactly if you're constantly worried about what this boss might say or what they might do at work that's going to create an unhealthy energy for you and unhealthy feelings at work so you can Channel all of that into a spell just like she'll said that'll give you much more peace of mind at work and I think that when you do something like that don't you know I love popits they're super fun but then there's always the end now what when you are making things  spell jar or a sour jar whatever the case maybe there's the end then what and now what you know how do I dispose of this how do I get rid of this make that a part of your spouse with popits I like burning them I make a papa I do what I need to do with it and then I kept it all off with lightness shit on fire I think the last step up vet is the enzyme what are you doing with either your papa or your jar or you know the piece of paper you've written you know it's it's the invent what I think burying things burning things I love burning things that you said that because so many people wanted will what do I do with the remnants of the spell you should have thought of that before you spell I like it to match what I want to happen like we we talked about a little bit earlier if you're burning it that's making something happen fast  putting it out to the universe you know that energetically it's destroying it very quickly maybe something needs to die in a fire and that's your energy or maybe it just needs to be consumed then go to the university pens on your point it might just be things that just need to be burned away maybe it needs to get thrown in the garbage like your stinky asked needs to get thrown in the trash because their trash it if it's a jar spell it could be something like you know what I just need to bury it be done with it some issues in your life you just need to bury and be done with it rocks it turns into something else and very often it can turn into something better that can help you all good things so make your jar out of an egg shell with all your stuff in there so that way you don't have to worry about bearing and it can actually compost to become part of the earth and transmuted so if you need Transportation energy if you want whatever this bad thing was to be change slowly over time into something good  . if you needed to be pulled away and washed in the ocean put it in running water because running water will move something along move things forward or move it away from you put it in the toilet again if you need that running water to pull it away from you but it's also kind of shity put it in the toilet to get rid of fire and if you make a jar jar like an actual jar at those are supposed to be long-term spells if you're burying an actual jar jar that's usually something on your property that you're going to be Steward for a long time not something you're just going to put willy-nilly out in the woods and also jars are mostly for visual spell she put the spell in there to have a certain look to it so that whenever you look at it or someone else looks at it reactivate Andre powers that spell it was really no other reason to put a spell in a jar but again like I said you know you want to make sure that you're doing the inventing what piece of it  I know you don't want to be doing any sort of baneful magick and then keep that you do on your Fireside mantle for the next two years but again like you said you know these are things that you need to think about prior to the spell not like okay I did this a week ago what do I do with this jar now and also make sure that you're ready for the energetic requirements of doing a spell in the freezer spell doesn't require a lot of energy you know you put their name in there you can put some energy into it with your intention and you toss it in the freezer and it's done but some of these bigger working somebody wronged you and you need to make sure that they get out of your life and don't hurt you or anyone else ever again energy and that's not usually something that are beginner is ready for or capable of so do smaller spells first practice get used to handling that energy get used to the feel of that energy before you  price to a bigger working going back to our episode on energy work you know you really need to you need to be able to work with that energy and if you are new then you need to maybe focus a little bit on energy work first before you start jumping into two baneful hexing needing safe space all of those are part of baneful magick but they're all part of all magic and try practicing those parts will get you stronger for the rest of it and it kind of goes back in the beginning when we said like preventative protection magic is important even if you're not being attacked right now because you don't want to have to learn to swim when your drowning you want to have those skills now when you're safe before you need them you know I have heard this I think since Pre-K and it's not wrong practice makes perfect you know practice creating a little soap bubble practice putting up your mirrors in your wall  words and all of these things because like you said you don't want to have to be floundering when the moment comes where you need these skills yeah and a lot of us have one co-worker or that person in the lake group or the cooking class on Wednesday night so whatever there was that one person that constantly has negative energy and is shooting daggers and you just need them to back off put up those energies practice putting up those mirrors and those Wards to bounce that energy back to them and protect your peace protect your space so I actually came up with a spell I was thinking of kind of a kind of you don't along our theme of just kind of backed the fuck off man I need a stress-free summer and you're killing my vibe so what I came up with to put in my egg shell I've got garlic  now because some of what I what I would maybe do this for could potentially involve a family member so I do have rose thorns so I got garlic rose thorns cayenne pepper cornmeal blacks all but I also put in an obsidian Stone in a rose quartz with black salt is the rose quartz has me intrigued because like I said this this kind of involves you know this isn't just some Joe Schmo off the street you know a little more family-oriented so the obsidian is repelling negativity at the Rose Court is to try to kind of Foster and create a more loving atmosphere so these are ingredients not to banish this person from your life but more to get rid of the negative and and Foster more positive rose quartz loving energy if I had to name this spell I probably be able to stop you  douche man  describe within that alright keep going I love it also with it you know everything I do of this nature I always include me or so there's a mirror involved and either a red purple or black candle now the red in the purple eyes again it kind of like what the rose quartz you know I'm not trying to like make this person go away forever I just need them to kind of take a step back and be like huh you know I'm kind of an asshole and you should stop being that way I would say red would be for adding a little extra power black would be for a little extra protection and neutralizing the situation and purple could be for sovereignty for you having control of the situation and for that person being more chill and that's what I need I need for this person to be a little more chill so that's why for my particular one it might seem weird that I'm using rose quartz as well as rose thorns make sense can also replace those things with say stinging nettle or  you know I love you backs because they like stick to you they're prickly and stick it to you so it's like that love keeps on giving great if they need to learn a lesson and have it stick exactly the Saudis are kind of components that I I came up with specifically for for the type of thing that I'm looking to do but if you do you can kind of replace anything out with something that suits you or your need a little better just because I'm using the the rose quartz in the rose thorns you might want to use no stone is it all and all stinging nettle maybe you want to use sulfur you can use match head sulfur to you can use any type of urine cat urine particularly cat poo and Cat Noir and I find a lot in baneful spells you can use vinegar vinegar is another one to get rid of somebody I've seen people make a like almost like a tea out of heating up vinegar and  baneful herbs which the sounds awful before I've used Windex not going to lie clean them right out of your life was perfect but anything's better mustard seeds screws Licorice and graveyards are a lot of people talk about using graveyard dirt quick disclaimer don't take graveyard if you're not allowed to be there like please don't go to Salem and start scraping up graveyard you going to get in big trouble like big trouble right but graveyard dirt from an ancestor is wonderful protection there's all sorts of different reasons why you might take graveyard dirt and why it's really good but it's very powerful and you should do all sorts of things before you take the graveyard dirt but instead of graveyard I have two different things that you can use that are a little less potent but sometimes you might want that you tell so you can take a little bit of dirt from a dead plant still living right now by the way  graveyard dirt can be substituted with dirt from a dead plant or can also be substituted with dirt that is under or near roadkill oh that's a good one I never thought of that as well as I had one time I had this ex-husband still like pee outside all the time he was a weirdo I don't know can't explain it and I have actually gone out before I dug out in the backyard of my house dug up some of that dirt that had Layla really been peed and and you just kept moving on  watching where you leave your tag like people so those are all sorts of wonderful things to put in the Shell so so what else would you Rochelle spell show the last piece of it was writing and I had shows and you know me I do not ever right and blacking but for this type of magic I would write in Black Ink on the white eggshell it might be a name they might be a phrase like it's an eggshell you it's not like you're writing out a whole spell on an eggshell here so just something that's kind of pointed to that spell for me it would particularly with the name but you can doctor it anyway you want and then literally just bury it in the yard with all of those things in it now of course you're thinking to yourself while you know you don't want to bury stones and then there's a copy out with the candle to this stones in the candle what I would do with that is not necessarily put it in the shell  what I've done before is I have buried the eggshell and then you know replace the dirt Yerberia to the dirt back over at your back to flush land again I have burned the candle above where it was buried had kind of a Stones placed around the candle and when I do this type of thing I do not cleanse and reuse the stones I do get rid of them I like that you put the name on the shell in the lot of these spells you want to add something called at a Glock and what that is is something that identifies the person that the spell is intended to hit so I named their name names are very powerful if you put their name in there that works if you don't know their name right everything you can think about them like an optional most concentrate on that person concentrate on what they did concentrate on following energetically back what they did to that person and write it down as much as you can that's enough of a tag lock if you've got their hair  spit bodily fluids blood skin all of those things work threads from clothing that they wear regularly makeup that they use all the time at their favorite pen you know something that is intrinsically associated with that person is a padlock and so you can use that for the spell to directly go to that person know if you were doing this type of thing what would be some ingredients that you might use and how might you put them together a lot of them I'm very literal and end for spells like this I tend to use a lot of Chili's and a lot of get away from me Tech stuff I don't tend to do a lot of this type of spell because I'm more of a put the mirrors up put up my Wards and walk on with my life I have too much going on to worry about some petty-ass hole so I put up the mirrors they get whatever they put out doesn't affect me that's actually let's talk about that real quick that's actually a really good point because a big part of this magic is accepting it or not  you said that before part of it is has you believing in it and if you think that if you totally believe in it or not that's going to affect the spell I have at most confidence in my words and my protections and my cleansing so I seriously doubt you're going to get past my ancestors my Wards my spirit Guardian so I'm not too worried about it but if I was and I felt that I needed to do some baneful magick towards someone I do like peppers I like hot I like stinging I like it to leave a mark and I like it to make a point so I will put a lot of pointy things in there at your house the one thing I have done in the past with someone who particularly needed to learn their own lessons is I've done a spell like this with the peppers the vinegar the nasty T the cat urine the spiky things and I put it in a spell  directed it towards them we totally need to do an episode on how you collect cat urine cuz I'm curious. Clumping litter you send that energy out to them but like you said with the Burdock's you want that to stick to them and have that kind of follow them around so I like to put that energy into an Edgar car into a spot form sometimes it's a dragon sometimes it's in the other entity and that follows that person and it's almost like a angels and Devils on your shoulder, back whenever that person does anything negative or does anything negative could come back to me or whoever I'm trying to protect the egregore will send the energy to them and make sure that the energy returns to that person's right back to them they're very rare times when I felt the need to actually bury somebody 6 ft under no I think it's also important to note that not every person  is attacking you not everything is some magical plot against you and sometimes it just is are the evil eye kind that you know somebody cut off in traffic and you shoot a little negative energy their way or you cut someone off in traffic and they shoot a little negative energy your way most of them are kind of that small can still hurt can still cause problems but to do a big purse or a big working it require sustained large amounts of energy and you've got to decide whether or not that's worth your energy because honestly sometimes you're so caught up in the emotion of it in the moment that you think it's worth it and it's just not if you're giving them your time and your energy you're also feeding into what they're doing so it's it's the same exact thing you know you want to kind of put out that people are going to get back what they put it you but in the same respect you don't want to feed into their magic or  get into your own fears or feed into your own fears absolutely because that is something that magic is going to help you with and that goes back to the reflecting you know why do you want to do this or why do you think someone is doing that to you go through that bisects that see how you can handle it right sometimes the first spell that you need to reach for is a restraining order and not magic yeah yeah unfortunately sometimes not always where I need to worry about doing big painful magic I am lucky enough and privileged enough in my life right now that I keep my words up if I take care of everything I don't really have to worry about it I'm pretty good so that that might not be true for other people of your situation in your life is a lot more volatile that's going to be different so I think that the biggest thing is always I always go back to this it's it's your intention and  you are energetically putting into this put in that energy decide what you want out of it what is the result that you really want you really want them out of your life or are you looking for reconciliation is this person really shity or maybe do you need to respect boundaries a little better you know or maybe it is all them I don't know but think about it and then keep your piece set up your boundaries it's okay to do that s good to do that you should set boundaries it is okay to be angry it's okay to be mad it's okay to feel these things and to work through that however works best for you you just need to decide whether or not it's something you should be lashing out or working on don't have anyone in your life that needs to be hackstore banished but if you do we got you got you got some ideas for going to have more spellcraft summer episodes coming up including a three-part  series on spell word correspondences writing spells and how to power your spells are so excited I love summer magic time I feel like it's the most magical time of the year it's also a wonderful basketball time of year oh my God I can't wait I cannot wait for us to go see you soon is finally here that means camping camping and this year not only are we possibly going to go to a pagan Pride somewhere on the East Coast we are also both going to be at Brushwood folklore Center for their Sankofa Festival know I know that you've been on a little Facebook Hiatus and we all understand and it's okay but I just want you to know we have at least one listener coming to send and I will also be there for the week following for the serious Rising Festival giving lots of workshops shell and I are also going to be doing a radio show together with we will put the link so you can listen in live to the  still radio show I need a DJ name  for what are DJ name should be or what the theme of our musical to our program should be email us at back on the broomstick at gmail.com or go to our Instagram Facebook or web page back on the broomstick I just I just want a DJ named people give me DJ name something good. You got any ideas with that being said it's time to start packing so the little early but I know how you pack so yeah but it would suggest stuff and I got you anything you need whether it's like a saw I've got it in the trunk of my car I think I needed a sewing machine once and you had it so yeah I believe it was me everything to a man that's right all right thank you all so much for listening to back on the broomstick we will see  in the meantime stay cool be wise be Wicked and keep it witchy without your skin melting off

back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode we're talkin about lifter the summer holiday Midsummer the time of fireflies and fairies and late-night magic the time when everything is warm and Lush and beautiful and I'm sure she'll and I have famously dubbed with the Forgotten have it it's it's a thing I don't know why but here we are we are not forgetting so I think that this would be a good time to talk about litha to talk about fairies I love fairies fairy magic and things that you can do for Alyssa right now how do you want to start with the vibe of Lissa as one of those if the longest day and the shortest night during the summer solstice which occurs around June 20th or 21st in the northern hemisphere the North Pole of the planet is tilted closest  listen and this means that the sun will reach its highest point in the sky at noon so whatever noon is for your local time the Sun will reach its highest point at noon for several days before and after the solstice and it'll seem to be in the same position every day at noon so it almost appears like the sun stands still which is why it's so easy to observe and why this holiday has been acknowledged by so many different cultures for thousands of years so the sun pauses at noon and that results in the longest day and the shortest night of the year that means that the summer solstice marks the exact moment when the Sun appears that his northernmost point in the sky and it's that point where again it stands still and it's what we call it the solstice because it's two Latin words soul in Statham Statham to stand still and the exact moment of the solstice is on June 20th at 10:42 p.m. eastern time  so she lives somewhere else the time is going to be different you know I have mixed feelings about this because here we are in the Northeast it kind of feels like summer is just starting and then the thought of it just started and now here's the longest day and it's all downhill from here that it doesn't settle well yeah and sometimes it's even called Midsummer and why do we call it Midsummer if it's technically the first day of summer it's also a perspective I think that's because the accounts had two seasons they had winter and they had summer so the summer solstice comes right in the middle of what would have been their summer season right because they looked start of summer so when I think of Midsummer I kind of think it's almost like they're two separate things to me  honoring the Sun the flushness the growth all the things that are new and fresh and they're making me so stuffed up right now that I'm a loser the thickest I think of with Lissa but with Midsummer I think more traveling between our Realm of the fairy realm in the magic this of it and just two separate events in my brain isn't that so I mean Lissa is the fairy realm and it is a liminal space is one of those stickers of my baby and you could you do you could absolutely say lippa is just the day of the event and Midsummer is more of like the season an extended time summer it's kind of warm summer nights I don't know I think Midsummer there's something about the day and the night that I think are drastically different  about about the summer season and maybe that's where I kind of differentiate the two lifts us more of the bright sunlight celebration in my mind and then some more of the evening Night Celebration at the braiding the sun Bell the sun god or sometimes you'll see lose celebrated as well the king of the two audits on in so you can celebrate that energetic go get them grow everything type of power during the day and then at night is that more sensual the fireflies the warm air on your skin you know the lifestyle of a fires in the distance you know that kind of  differentiated by like those have the fairies and that you got over on and Tatiana and talk as long as you're not there a lot of people associate Midsummer with the feelings of that player that movie because that is about people who go into the woods and love affairs triangles I don't know but it's all about that sensual summer magic of the night and that's exactly what I think of with Midsummer where is litha it's about the sun shining and everything being lost you know this is all so I never have thought of it as one of the Harvest festivals but if you think about it  is because this is where kind of the first things are starting to barely starting to trickle in as yeah yeah it is that everything is so abundant the seeds you planted physically and metaphorically earlier in the year are now above ground the rights are flowering they're starting to produce everything around you is growing and so the energy that you can tap into his that same kind of green growing abundant energy that's the god the son that vibrant move forward kind of energy that you can tap into during the day with the sun you're getting those first tastings of the fruits of your labor right so the energy right now is all energy it's all new beginnings it's also a good time I think it's the kind of shed we're at the halfway point as far as the calendar year we're kind of it that six month mark  it's also time I like to utilize to you know I had this planned refiguring things you know maybe where you were magically six months ago is it where you are magically now there's a whole slew of things that can change in six months so I think it's also a good time to commune with Al and talk to those land spirits to see where you're at. Need to go see what you need to adjust it's a great time feet on the ground time is what I like to call it this is the time especially here in the Northeast for we can finally without freeze the ground and so it's a good time to kind of do that 6-month re-centering not just by the calendar but also celestially this is a liminal time the sun is at its strongest it reaches its peak  and now it's going to gradually get less strong it's going to suck some days it's going to go into its waning phase with the strength of the sun will be waning and the Knights will slowly start to get longer this cycle of the son and of the god mirrors the moon phases and the phases of the Goddess it's just on a year-long cycle instead of a monthly one so in the southern hemisphere it's actually you will right now but you know I love you I just don't like the cold world the solstice is a Midway point of the Year midwinter or Midsummer the sun begins to get stronger or it begins to get weaker this is also a division of the Year episode last year we talked about the oak King in the Holly King this is when the power of the oak King is at its height and then starts to gradually Wayne until the Holly King takes over for the  dark half of the year do you have that going on as well as much as I look at it as no voice like the beginning of the end as far as the year goes there's a whole lot of season left this isn't Doom and Gloom and for the southern hemisphere it's the the longest night and now they have that gaining son to look forward to I think that a lot of a lot of things that we do magically go and Ebbs and flows with the season and the easier that starts to come to you the more you get in a groove or you're not feeling the exact idea of what to do when to do how to do and you just kind of feel it when it comes how many times do you do you get into this group with magic where you just kind of feel it as it comes and I think that's where my division you know kind of circling back to the midsummer  I start to feel like that difference in Magic between day and night this time of year is different than Night Magic this year night cycle that's mirrored in the wheel of the year and that's why I love following that type of psycho because if you follow those subtle shifts of nature those subtle shifts all around you you can really start to get in tune with that just like you said to feel those shifts between the Day and Night Magic you can start to feel those shifts of the Earth's natural rhythms in yourself too and be more at June's that you know that can help you be more grounded in your magic that can help you even more connected to your craft and connected to your magical self sometimes our perspective in the Northeast on celebrating the sabbats is a little different with folks in different regions with different climates and different landscapes  quick touch on a message via email from someone at the end of their email this person says it's a little dangerous to be out of the broom closet here and they are from Southeast Texas. We're just going to refer to them by their first initial of K thank you for emailing us it was very very nice email and just going to kind of paraphrase a little bit now K has been on the which passed since 2018 and has been loving our podcast from thank you very much for that and she listened to our 2023 episode on Lyft I highly recommend that we talked about the oak King in the Holly King really really good then y'all two are in Texas this summer is oppressive draining exhausting and we just try to survive the Heat and the drought the grass is brown and prickly and hurts to walk through  scorpions rattlesnakes copperheads water moccasins and black widows are abundant Dusty and constantly being blown into dust devils that hurt to breathe in when the South winds blow the humidity feels like an energy vampire riding on my shoulders she says that even though she's Sun oriented and hates the cold summer means that she's inside shut off from the outside world does not feel magical at all so everything that we like about the summer have the same thing yeah I never been to Texas and boy if that wasn't the most poignant description I have ever heard and I stayed in Texas I have quite a few relatives that live in Texas so I am familiar with this weather now when I first moved to California I didn't know what to do because the landscape  so different than the very wet Forest of the Finger Lakes in New York state that I was familiar with and then I fell in love with it it just took one camping trip to Joshua Tree and seeing the stars and hearing the life and seeing the rattlesnakes and the dust devils and yes even the black widows in my backyard to appreciate that it was a black widow picture is beautiful it's scary and it's different but it's gorgeous and it's powerful and you can honor its power by acknowledging its force and choosing shade shadows and rest work with the sun energy when it's softer in the morning or in the evening or while you're indoors in the air conditioning but work with that hospice acknowledge the Sun as a god of fear  discipline. Just gross and radiant and beautiful summer days he is the god of power but also responsibility of different sides to that season and the serpent 2 is also a symbol of solar power absorb the energy of the sun they coil on themselves they are a symbol of Hecate and so many different goddesses and gods you know there's power and honor in that as well so the god that sun god is an acknowledgment that sometimes power comes with responsibility for finding those differences and what they can teach you is is part of being a witch and I know that Joshua tree is not the same as Southeast Texas but people have been finding magic and connection to the Gods in the desert for ever it is so easy to go out there and feel such a deep connection to everything to feel that Vibrance that life that magic  it's somehow the desert is so full of and even though at first glance it might look dead or empty there's so much are the magic is powerful Jim Morrison being out in Joshua Tree at night with the Stars I mean he wrote really weird crazy magical songs about that because that place is powerful you can feel it in the desert and if this goes right back to how I kind of differentiate by the way the stars are amazing in Texas I would think so I used to say that the sun in the summer time in Southern California was trying to kill us it was not the benevolent Forest go to the attempt you to go to a  bonfire and fool around with them know this guy really wants to kill you he'd like to give you some cancer and maybe you should die  out there cuz I still love it up into that tap into those energies you know learn about the different life that's dependent in the summertime there so you'll have to celebrate the season slightly differently for me in Southern California it's definitely different in Texas but February March April all my gosh the abundance everything is green and growing so things are different there at different times of season so you have to adapt these yes it's still the longest day and the shortest night yes your God your son got a difference in this has been our son God is at the same time of year here in the Northeast so you have to work with him work with that energy differently it's a little stronger so when you make your son tee it's going to be powerful is going to be that heavy angry you know that we've been honestly really angry cuz I don't I don't necessarily think the sun wants to kill you  no it's more like the sun in the desert want you to pay attention use common sense and know your limits just wants to whip you into shape a shape or maybe get you ready for the next season because I know a lot of plants in these places have to get hot some of them even need to burn before they can grow and so maybe the Sun God in your area is trying to whip you into shape is trying to mold you into who you need to be for the next season so work with the energy used where you're at it's difficult for us you know where were talking a lot about where we're at right now but I know just in the United States there's a lot of different environments at this time of year we talked about Spirit of place you know what you're saying totally makes me think of spirit of place that you know you got to connect with the land spirits of where you're at and do you know maybe you're in the burning deck  hell right now and text us utilize that utilize that but you don't work for that Spirit of place I talked to him. He's a little guy like that so yeah it is quieter maybe she's sleepy or maybe she comes more alive at night and you know you can absolutely do any magical working even if it's if it's trying to work with the evil Sun God you can do that at night time it's not that the box was taken away for the night it's just out of your view and just cuz it's one of you doesn't mean it's there when the sun's out of my fee which is totally gone  even if it was if it is when it's much easier and gentler to handle pretty much most places until it gets oppressive but summer nights can be absolutely sensual beautiful wonderful ways to connect with that warm more gentle sun energy that is still is giving that power and strength in abundance it's just giving it from it's dark where you're at and you can't see it thank you I'm so glad that you wrote to us and I'm so sorry that it's dangerous to be out of the broom closet there we hope you have good air conditioning all right so we keep talking about A Midsummer Night In A Midsummer Night's Dream  this holiday remind shell a lot of buffet end of that movie or the play A Midsummer Night's Dream it does we did way back there so we actually did have been Summer Nights theme ritual that that really strikes me the most about the summer nights and the midsummer night is in the nighttime are flies even more magnificent to see the food at least I feel like this time is a good time to connect with the FAE that there are those that are out there claiming that this is when the veil is thinnest between the face  and this realm and I do believe that to be true because especially when I think of the fact I'm thinking of you think of the fact I think of more summer time for this is definitely the time that I especially most associated with that Faye work and being able to make that connection the type of thing I would call Lynn spirit and in the Northeast she'd be most familiar with land that is awake mostly spring through the fall and then it goes to sleep for the winter basically and yes they're absolutely land Spirit Faith at thrive in the winter and the cold but they're not very abundant and they're not very nice so unless you're doing work with them you might not eat  be aware that they're all around you please be careful the FAE could be dangerous folk please be careful I'm not that bad summer solstice with the FAE mostly because solstices are liminal times and you'll hear a lot of witches and magical people talk about different holidays and the veil being thin weather between here and the spirit realm here in the FAE realm will talk about that a lot and the reason is because these are between times it's a time between a time so in this case this again is a Celestial event the longest day in the shortest night it marks a powerful threshold and the wheel of the year it's a pause the sun pauses in the Sky High at Midsummer at the height of its power is a moment when the energies of the light half of the Year shifts it reaches the height of its power but then it begins to wane  add pecans to March towards the dark half of the year so Alyssa is that threshold it's the height of abundance and warm the sun-drenched very Apex of power but is also a Tipping Point is also when the tide turns from that waxing to fullness to waning to the dark half so it's a threshold it's the moment of the sun God's greatest dominance and power but it's also the moment of his downfall you can teams that first whisper the first beginnings of the dark half of the Year this is a cycle this is cyclical it happens every year and that gives it its power that gives it its liminal quality so that makes it very predictable regular it's cyclical and so that makes it a very magical time it's a magical moment so if you wanted to celebrate that exact moment again that's June 20th at 10:42 p.m. Eastern and that's the exact  element of the solstice and there's actually sites all across the world that have formations a lot of a rock formations where they were Play Bill Grill whatever the case may be where the sun goes through a specific area right at the moment of the solstice it's Glastonbury I believe that is one of those spots and I also believe Stonehenge the Sun lines up between two pillars and Strikes the stone in the center I believe there's also something with the pyramids where the sun comes up directly between them on the solstice for 10000 plus years I mean they have evidence of this being at least marked and noted in many many cultures around the world Way Way Back Into history and the  because it is a moment against Leicester moment that you can measure and Mark and it does happen the same way every single year that's what gives it its liminal quality that's what makes it a magical marker in the universe and so that's why people talk about the veil being thin between the worlds because this magical cyclical moment has happened and occurred again and so that opens the world that opens the space and some people the Celts that Irish have the she that you are the diamond fairy folk The People Under the hill and they were here before humans were they were one of the many different types of people that were here and some people say that it was litha it was Midsummer when they had to go Underhill and went off into the fairy realm so sometimes they say that's why they're associated with a lot of lore and Tails associated with the FAE and midsummer  is she here what's out there yes you need to be careful working with the fat a should you be scared of working with the absolutely not but should you use an air of caution well yeah I'd say the same thing using bleach in the laundry we mostly say that basically you should be polite you should always say what you mean if you say you're going to do something make sure you do it well yeah and I'm also a big proponent of when you're working with the FAE bring gifts it's like going to your grandma's for Christmas gifts or another favorite of mine is honey bears like honey  I believe out for Alyssa or for summer time and will also mention a couple spells and ways to work with Midsummer and Faye energy in your practice you know what I did want to read it's it's almost like Silver Thread about his kind of course but it's really because to them they can make bracelets or ropes it was their size I was leaving these little 6-inch silver cords around they were nodding them and saying your wish into the machine. And then tying it on a tree's is often something that people will do to make offerings to Fay one of the things that I recently Learned was about the elder tree an elder trees or the witches tree sometimes it's also called The Fairy Tree by Al & Spirits sometimes called the mother  and if you see an elder tree and you want to take some berries or flowers from it or take some of its wood that you have to ask permission first which we kind of recommend using a specifically you have to ask permission because if you don't she would definitely get her revenge have to be careful that it was bad and she left it blank to let your imagination run wild follow directions we don't find out the bad stuff elder trees have a lot of faith Traditions around them they are sacred to the Fay and if you visit an elder tree especially around left eye you can make offerings to the tree and do that to make wish with the FAE can just make sure that whatever you offer them is worth whatever you're wishing for and that if you give them a gift of words or a gift of something that you'll do make sure you follow through  also I think working with the space gives you the opportunity because you you will be out and you will be kind of cool and while doing so we're good with the Fey are almost kind of doubles is having that connection with the land and that little bit more land like K deep in the Heart of Texas go out to your land and find out what your land is like go out with a son's not trying to kill you go out at night or whenever it's comfortable and walk your land walk it again not 4K don't walk at Barefoot because you might get bit by a snake but you know walk your land try to feel it put your hands in the dirt put your toes in the dirt touch a tree touch a plant or walk the sidewalks walk wherever it happens to be and listen to the land listen to the insects listen to the cars listen to the rhythm of the land around you and really try to connect with that  the nighttime is a fabulous in mid-summer because it just feels magical like there's something about it there's something that just feels different it does feel like that liminal space so if you have a night when the moon comes up in the breeze is warm and soft and you kind of feel that calling go out walk that land and see what it's like see what it says to you and you know I also think another good 20 is so we talked about how Lissa is technically at you know either the 20th or the 21st and you know I even joked earlier about how many times have we actually celebrated with Melissa Houston for that because maybe where you're at your environment and your surroundings aren't conducive for you to do something on the 20th or 21st but you'd be able to be third don't think that that is going to hinder your intentions at all and you don't  have to focus on the so much as that feeling that you have magic coming to you a date is just a date who made the calendar and see when is the solstice is an actual Celestial event I know but I also know that I haven't celebrated on the actual Celestial event and it's been exactly and the point is our old Community would usually celebrated on the weekends closest to yourself some sun tea during the day on the 20th and then at 10:49 p.m. Eastern you want to toast the God would that TV you can deep south so if it is blazing like the ass crack of Satan down there what about an outdoor  I'm talking more of the simmer pot nature not the drinkable nature so you're saying that you're harnessing the power of the sun to heat up herbs like making a potion almost like a son to me but more of a a spell Brew to use an offering or a spell component is that what you're making watches to make my house smell good okay alright I see what you're saying like an herbal potion traded with the energy of the Sun not t cuz you're not going to drink it you know cuz you can make us unto you spell right but you're talking about making a spell infusion beans ass crack of that song spell t h a t spell put your drinkable herbs in there put your mint for money put your chamomile 4-Piece put your green tea in there for power  whatever you need and use the power of the sun to do that or like she'll said try to brew yourself a potion make sun water makes solar water but Infuse it with those herbs put those herbs and things in there that you want in addition to the power of the Sun and then label it and now you've got this herbal concoction of energize some water with all the power and fused of these herbs that you've added to it as well water and you can have your some water please label responsibly just be cognizant if it's something they call that FDA approved so that you're you're not making yourself ill speaking of herbs and making yourself ill I want to take a left hand turn yourself I have been having a lot of fun with me  it's just thinking about it I know I know I was lamenting in an earlier episode that we didn't have any here well that's because we mowed it all down before we reach  we moved in later in the spring last year so a lot of it already before you got here so this year we didn't came up like crazy because it's invasive and put in a lot of places in the United States so I've been harvesting it for a little bit I harvested some early mugwort I've heard some people say that you just harvested before it flowers I've also heard some people say that you should Harvest it on June 6th so I harvested a bunch then but mugwort is a dreaming herb mugwort is a mystical liminal space herb ironic that June 6th is a good time to pick it right before the solstice and it's also an herb associated with the FAE because you can work with mugwort in tea in smokable spell an incense in sachets fresh Drive is wonderful and funny story so I was out walking my woods and I found a huge patch of mud  and I picked a bunch of it early cuz it's a little bit less bitter that way for tea and it's also nice and smokeables a little early as well and holy cow the dreams she'll just from picking it the dreams that I had that night or so I have a bunch of it drawing and then I usually like to dry it just for a couple days I don't want to be fresh fresh when I make it into a smoke bundle if I'm going to be wrapping it into a bundle I like it to be a little on the dryer side like not crispy but dryers but yes the one I took it down after a few days you know what it was ready to be bundled again the dreams holy cow especially in June right around Alyssa if you want to work with a favor if you want to do DreamWork gather yourself some fresh mugwort put the leaves in a little  cotton or linen bag whatever you've got put it under your pillow put it near your bed and ask for dreams do a ritual where you ask for it tell the herbs your intention I want to dream about my future job I want to dream about the best relationship from me that your intentions asked the herbs to help you and then put them next to your bed with a journal or your phone ready to record in this case it's really really important especially if you cross the Hedge if you're doing liminal dreaming if you're doing magical dreaming it can be so ephemeral that can be so fleeting so definitely have something to write down or record your dreams as soon as you wake up hit that record button and say everything tell your sleepy self before you go to bed I will remember to hit the record button or I will remember to  write down everything I think of the only thing I want to know is there are other options besides if you are allergic to it like I am the things I just happened to have an experienced this year with mug Parts I make me want to go and touch you know it already Makes Me stuffed up and I can't breathe just cuz it grows near me to swell rub it and touch it have dreams there's a lot of different stories about how you can see the face and summertime when the nights are magical and the fairies are out is a perfect time it's feels magical skills like fairies are there so there's also a couple different things that you can do one I heard when I was very little was it if you look between a cat's ears when they're staring at nothing you could see fairies interesting I also have a couple different song  because I've also heard that like if you take elderflowers and make like an elderflower you don't even have to make it to staying out of it you can just kind of soak it in the water for a little bit and then just touch that water to your each of your eyelids and your third eye and say a charm you could see the FAE you can also do that with mugwort you can make like at it like I said a little too saying or a little tea out of mugwort cool it down or just soak it in the water a little bit and just gently touch each eyelid and your forehead not if your shell not if you're allergic to it isn't your thing you could take a little bit of cat hair or cat nip along with some type of dreaming herb like blue lotus or Damiana mix them in water also guessing on the intent of being able to see into the ferry or the magical realm and then under a summer moon in under an elder tree for best results have a bit of that water onto your eyelids and your third eye while repeating your intention to have to cite or to see through false Hood Zoar to see the FAE  don't look too deep in the hole of a tree because if you look too deep in the Hall of a tree of fairy will look back out at you know I like that little face looking at me you can also do a spiral fairy wish spell was just a stone and a few leaves or petals strand of grass or whatever find a spot outside and Center yourself take a deep breath and state your wish or your intention and then start to slowly walk in word in a spiral and every few steps just dropped a little bit of the pedals or the leaves and repeat your wish you know whatever it is your intention is to slowly walk this spiral dropping those titles and stating your wish over and over when you get to the center old your rock or Pebble that you brought with you and bury it in the dirt and thank the Earth thanks buffet for making your wish come true then walk back out the spiral and don't look back and don't return to that spot for 3.  and your wishes come true I want to Circle back real quick because you made me tell you what I would leave is a a gift for the FAE but you never told us what you would leave is a gift for the FAE I personally like to leave plants I like to bring some of my plants out there likes me flowers I like to make offerings by working Mile and I guess I like the cleanup Mile and I like to take care of it and in doing that I feel that I am helping to Steward the FAE of my land open cuz I'm kind of up keep their home yeah yeah and sometimes when I make a garden and I will plant flowers in their particularly for the fairies so that they can have beautiful things there but most of the time I okay actually my favorite thing to do is fairy chess and we've talked about this before very chaste is something I learned from a green egg magazines a long time ago there was an article Oberon Zell and morning glories out I believe this morning glory sell who created this game  if I have a stamp or a rock or as a small patch of dirt on the ground and you take other little things not try not to disturb the land's too much you know everybody knows that making those Stone tiles are probably not good for the environment I'm just talking about its wing here at least there may be a little flower that's fall in or stone just take these little objects little things that seem magical that maybe call to you and arrange them in a pretty little shape on that stump or rock or dirt get kind of elaborate or keep it very simple depending on where you're at like here on my land I like to make very pretty signals and symbols and circles and spirals with a different flowers in the grasses and things that are here but that's because it's here and I know that it's getting chopped down in a few days so it's not going to really matter so I can use a ton of it but if you're at a public park or something you might be a little more and make a little pretty symbol for them  or make a little house out of bark and offer that to them now not all Fey are the cute little cymbeline I kind of say a lot of them are large and glowing and biggest people but still making these little offering these little symbolic offerings to the land can be very beneficial in furthering your relationship with them so yeah mostly taken care of and sometimes a little bit so I have a confession. I just I was thinking that same thought the other night actually have a pair of scissors in my car and I politely asked for a couple of roses and did a very nice little slow. That's what I liked about it and are very cool liminal space  I love that you left it on the windowsill because doorways Windows also liminal spaces between here and there so if you want to have a physical connection like a lot of times we talked for like magic a windowsill being a liminal space can help you cross that Faye liminal space to buy leaving an offering in a doorway or in a window that's definitely connects you to do that but you also have to remember you're also at that point inviting them in that's sure to make sure that you recognize that and you understand that relationship again if you make any promises you keep up your end of the bargain cuz you don't want to find out what happens if you don't it ain't fun it's like kind of making your parents mad no fun your litha rituals with the FAE whether it's your land Fae or you're trying to connect with the two aides on in like Lou you can do that by embracing the essential in your life  slowly in the Moonlight where are your favorite scent where luxurious clothing another way is to do a glamour spell you can do that by creating a mask take one of those plain Carnival masks and some paint or markers glitter you can use natural objects like feathers Mosby's whatever you like ribbon charms whatever and have a mirror nearby Center yourself relax and say something like I stepped between the worlds of leaf and light where Faith ants in Beauty site but glamorize and masks reveal the secret self I now am and feel and then decorate your mask color it painted blue things to it feathers make it as interesting cool magical whatever as you like and while you're making the masks three times during while you're making the masks look into the mirror and each time I say something different that you love about yourself gay isn't a reflection sale  you love about yourself go back to working on the mask and do that three times when you finish the mask State your intention which is should be some type of quality that you want to bring out of yourself or honor with them maybe it's Beauty self-confidence maybe it's magic or inner-sight whatever it is and then gaze into the candle flame and imagine yourself shimmering with this glamour breathe in breathe out slowly draw in the beauty or whatever it is that you have created an anchor that into you and it's your sense of self put the mask on look into the mirror one more time and state that you have that quality I am Beauty I am strength whatever it is that you made that mask for look at yourself and say that really feel it and then take the mask and keep it on your altar as a reminder of all those things that your drawing into your life  Brothers deep big fairy two presences and here I am currently a good example of the movie Tinkerbell is a good example of fairies that's always nice and I think that was the misconception I had until I had learned better and I think sometimes I thought is all about abundance and it's about Crossing this liminal space it's mid-summer we're going from the days growing longer to the nights are now starting to grow longer so since we're crossing that liminal space doing a ritual or a spell to help you get into the next phase of your life or to help you maybe the Seas that you planted back in earlier in the year now you've evaluated you seen how they started to grow  now you want to see where they're going to go for the next part of the year the next half of the year so you can focus your energies or your spells in that direction incorporate the FAE by having the spell be something that you create maybe you roll a candle or maybe you make a braid or or some type of not work and so you can incorporate craftsmanship which the FAE appreciate into that as well so kind of you know going back to the Midsummer Night's Dream you and I randomly call upon the faith throughout the year for various things and I kind of look at this is also a big thank you because you know what do you do in the summertime you know people have parties people have barbecues people have Gathering of family reunions it's it's a time of year where people do to get together so it's also kind of a good time or your ritual can just be a thank you thank you for everything that you have assisted with this  past year and for the future assistance and kind of make it almost like a gratitude ritual don't say thank you thank you too much you should say I appreciate your assistance your assistance helps me in celebration of assistance is celebrating their assistance I could go back to that word I can't I could just roll it off my tongue I'm such a people pleaser thankful for abundance be thankful for the energy of the Fey that's in your life you know what is a barbecue a bonfire or you're celebrating fire and summer and that abundance so you don't operate all of that in there I just have these visions of little fairies using little flowers to get drunk off of using them as their little cup people feel the Little Flower cookie cookie  since Falls or maybe it's Morgan theme lyrics called I'm not sure but I tend to see the face like big shining scary people who are very beautiful and very angry and I don't see him like that I see a more kind of a compact figure that is very delightful unless you cross them until I get to that point and I tend to look at the site as delightful and unless you cross that cross that line so you're kind of like Tinkerbell you can have a happy tank and angry tank happy Shaolin angry show celebrate the energy use of the land around you feel the land take this time this is a good time if you have the opportunity if you are able to do the location feel the land even if that is literally going out  bare feet on the ground and has something to say and summer time is a wonderful time of abundance even if the closest you can get to the land is finding a farmers market see if you can connect that way there's lots of different ways to connect with that abundance but don't let it continue to be the holiday that people seem to forgot I think that as much as we're all busy right now we need to remember to celebrate those tickets to the wheel when that wheel turn this and it's easy to kind of pass some of them by to the circumstance but let us not be the Forgotten holiday can out there enjoy the day if as much as you can enjoy the night and the energies of abundance and fertility and the world the light I think the biggest thing especially for us here in the northern hemisphere the light vitamin D  deficiency is a thing so we like our sunlight and into know that we've waited all year for the peak of and here it is do something with that energy you've got the strength and the abundance and the growth so use that energy in your life to find those things and to apply that wherever you need it today there is a light, enjoy it and now you are creeping towards the light however the light is in your half of the Year we hope you are enjoying it and we hope to see you at next week would have another episode coming up for you and maybe a couple Surprises with me now and then I need to get in touch with us in the meantime send us an email sent us an Instagram DM send a Facebook message  shortly that information is down in the show description of the episode we hope you enjoy your summer solstice until then be wise be Wicked and keep it witchy

welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode we're talking Tara wisdom and Earth medicine with author artist and Mystic will La Nina Simone and I am shell and we are so excited to welcome you back later on you in such a great time the last time we talked about your amazing Cosmic seed tarot today we have a new deck and we are super excited this is the wise Earth medicine tomorrow and we've got a lot to talk about so before we jump in just again I know we've had you before but tell the listeners a little bit about who you are and what you do well thank you my name is Lilia Simone I am so grateful to be back with you too and yes I have been very busy since we've last connected and my favorite to date deck is now out in the world and it's so exciting to be  able to talk about it and start to see it on socials and people starting to make videos and it makes me so so happy I might be my favorite one time you said you've been a little busy since we last spoke to decks that's more than a little busy you are you are putting out awesome work and you actually have a second deck that you mentioned that just got released off Kickstarter about a month ago just give us the name of that real quick and that was just that campaign just completed on Kickstarter on the first week of March I will be coming into the world closer to the end of this year cuz I'm in the process of getting the book written and stop. Deck is about mythology and Tiny that world mythology and obscure mythologies and tying those to the cards and so it's going to have a very comprehensive book and so that's the process time  I love that now I do love your books in each of your Decks that we have the cosmic seed and now and they Wiser's medicine tarot your books are lovely they have full color pictures of each of the cards also in your previous deck you included a Tarot spread that you created in each of these books when we spoke to you before we had talked about the spiritual growth tarot spread talking you said that you added two cards to the bottom of that like the route and that really added a lot of depth to the tarot spread and our listeners loved it we sent that out so people could see that can you talk to us a little bit about coming up with tarot spreads and how you like to use them you do for yourself so that is my go-to spread if I'm reading for anybody and I'm planning on giving a semi I like the reading I will use that one because I feel like it goes in and I do create spreads kind of just as needed depending on what someone is kind of looking for  wanting to give them the best the best reading that I can the best information that I can I will kind of create a reading for them but generally I stay with that one I also have a workbook out I don't have it in the world right now I'm repainting it for my Kickstarter people but it's a workbook that is just spreads and has about 13 spreads in it and you can fill in all the blanks and it's really a fun little cool tool I will be looking forward to that one for sure I'll send them to you I like how you mentioned that you kind of create them as you work with someone and I I like that to intuitive tarot spreads you and kind of have positions that means something to you like in your case the spiritual growth spread and then you expand on that as you work with some of the cards come out they start the kind of weave a story together to find that kind of works for you that way yes  shut off the car I need spreads I like the structure that kind of love how that story goes I know how would you tell someone to trust themselves or or two to allow that story to flow cuz I find that some people when they put the cards down whether intuitively or whether they're following a map with a spread sometimes they they falter on weaving the story or I'm putting that together do you have any advice to help someone kind of let go in to find that Rhythm to help them find that story in the car I feel like my specialty really is the artistic side of Taro I'm very logic minded and so it was really important for me to to learn all of the meanings to be able to feel like I'm on effective tarot card reader because the intuitive aspect of it is a little choppy for me so  nothing that I created with a flash card deck to learn all the meanings of the cars just all the keywords for the basic deck so things like that are things as it's something that I I kind of need to have a basic understanding but it's so beautiful to watch people who could just look at the images and Gloom a meaning and interpretation a kind of weave everything together for me I have to kind of have a basic understanding of what the the actual meaning is our and then if I can look at everything together I can start to pull the threads and I can start to go outside of those meetings and into it but I do have to have that find foundational kind of understanding and that's just the way I I work I love having the foundation of the spread and the meanings of the positions tampering with the cards but then being able to build on that use that as your solid foundation and then kind of build up from it like a cake I can check that way I also feel that  depending on who you are different artwork is going to speak to you differently and as a person who owns a gazillion tarot decks I've seen all kinds of tarot art and some even after doing readings for 30 years I'm just like I know this isn't working for me and then other cards like your Cosmic seed deck I feel like that is like that's speaking to my soul and you know the picture is on the cards almost jumped out at me where is I can't say that about a lot of deck so I think some of that also comes down to connecting with your card if you are very much into say all things Celtic and Celtic art work and stuff you know maybe a Native American Deck isn't going to speak to you so I think some of it is and that's how I started my collection of tarot decks 30 years ago was I was looking for the right artwork to speak to me  drawn into the the visual experience of the deck and it doesn't necessarily matter what the book says not love the the writing style of the artists of the deck but if I love the visual spend it's a good fit with Oracle on the other hand I need both the visual and the writing to kind of being fantastic I'm glad you mentioned Oracle decks and Tarot but I have a confession when I first open this deck I fell in love with the art and I told she'll I didn't like it as a terror attack I changed my mind cuz I'm looking at it Instinct was shocked this isn't the page of Swords like what's going on here and it took me aback I hold on these are so gorgeous I'm going to work with this from  because I can't not the pictures absolutely villania drew me in so much I love them so I gave it a second chance and now I love it but I was like this is an oracle Zach this is like an oracle Tarot deck and then I read that you said that right in the guidebook, I get it now and it was really the young it was the devil card that got me the devil card in this card okay so this deck is entirely animals and plants they're all the cars are beautifully themed if you felt like the moon patterns some have herb some have flowers from have animals and have both but the devil card is Poppy's how perfect is that amazingly perfect for the devil card I had to give it a second chance and give it a deeper look and looking at it like an oracle deck sorry to go to wrap up this long story here because I know the meanings of the car  and you do put keywords on the bottom a lot like a a lot like and an Oracle deck wood so that can kind of help you if you're not super familiar and you usually rely on the pictures because these pictures are different but that gives it a deeper meaning to me and it allows me to go different places than a traditional Tarot deck would much like an oracle deck does as soon as I let go of my need for it to be like a traditional rider-waite-smith Zack and let it be a little more orqali I had so much fun and so much inside reading these cars so I'm glad I gave her the second chance of the feeling I really wanted to make it accessible to people who cuz I have a metaphysical shop I saw dexta people everyday and people always ask me the difference between Oracle tarot and often if they're brand new do they end up with the oracle  and it's because of the complexity of the tarot and so my thought was if I could make it kind of cross over then people could get the experience of what it of using the easier type of deck and still kind of subconsciously start to absorb this information and that's why I also wanted the keywords on there because you don't get that instant understanding just from you know whatever is happening on the card you still have access to that information and the medicine of course of each meaning of each card bring so much so much stuff to the card itself to the meaning of the card and it is like the Oracle side of it I guess I just don't make things in the normal way and that's good I think it's particularly where this is concerned and if you didn't know what the devil card was and you saw Poppy's that's an addiction but it's Beauty  yeah but it it's all so seductive it's that thing that can be bad for you but you still kind of wanted you know when two people can understand that with poppies maybe and it might make that that meaning call my little bit more for them than the traditional imagery might took it at a different angle because I'll be honest with you the Oracle thing went right over my head when I first got the deck and it actually took Leila to point it out to my right as a Tarot deck the deck without the book generally so I didn't really see the Oracle side of it until Layla pointed it out but you know what the Ten of Cups has you know what the fit with the strength card means enough over the years that you know you just tell me your card and I've already got a visual you know so when I see things like I'm going to have to talk about this card for a minute  when I equate that to a traditional traditional suit I know what this card means aside from the usual but the visual helps I saw this is a way to connect also with the animal spirit and in in a way to kind of get an in-depth a more in-depth understanding of the animals for me personally I don't know what's it been like eight nine months is business like a literally my whole life never saw an owl ever I move outside of Boston I got this damn I will follow me around outside so I looked at these is a way to get a more in-depth understanding of animal spirit you know some of these animals are also animals that I'm not exposed  what if I am trying to connect with my animal spirit or or a familiar such I look at these is a way to also do that to kind of connect with the different you know I want to feel zebra energy so negative fire I'm going to the concept of what I know about that card and kind of create in my mind I guess my thoughts on how is that going to connect to that particular animal or 10 of Earth what does that have to do with a kangaroo and how am I going to learn more about the spirit of a kangaroo through knowing that you've Associated it with that particular card you know what I'm saying I'm also looking at it as a way to kind of connect with 78 different plant and animal spirits to learn about the wisdom  the Earth and there's so much and there's so many different I mean indigenous cultures all over the world and when I say that I mean all people are indigenous to the Earth and those cultures the ancient cultures specially very much respected the the messages that they received from the presents and watching the animals in the ways that they behaved amongst each other and they derive meaning from that and you know Sophie ated with themselves and all these different ways and and took them as Omens and so it felt like a beautiful way to bring that into the world and I love how you did that with the medicine portion of each card you mention the medicine that that plant or animal can bring to you and you know a lot of us do a daily card Paul or three card poker or we'll ask questions when we need to internal it hopefully  level of the medicine that can bring you like the queen of wind is the B you know I love being and this medicine says that be careful not to get too over stimulated you know I can give you a warning or an idea of where to look into this has to be sure to redirect your mental energy and rest your mind when needed so it gives good advice good medicine good good idea that you can learn from these creatures can you tell us a little bit about animism in your life or how you might work with you around here where I am my family and we live in Aurora Colorado and we are blessed to be right block away from a creek and we're still in the city but there's a creek that goes through the city and they were smart enough to make it a park and to make it so that it had some nature kind of undisturbed nature around it  there's trails and it's just a little section but we get so much Wildlife we have beavers and deers of show up every once in awhile and muskrats and unexpected thing six frogs all the things that could be around here and where we are in Colorado so we're not getting Mountain Spirit Smith the Sara Lee but you might go there and see an egret randomly and if you haven't seen that in a while you might you know we'd come home and we pick up the book we have a really great book it called animal speaks it's an old book and it has a lot of these different beautiful animal messages totems or will go online if it's just happens to not be in that book or maybe you have a dream and you know what is it was random dream and do the baby turtle in it and don't you know want to know what is the what is the energy from this particular animal trying to say to me so  you know as I mentioned indigenous cultures I've been doing this forever it's an opportunity for us to tap into the Earth and to Mother Nature Into You Know What I Call great mother and hear the the wisdom from our spiritual selves and our higher self and just like we use the tarot it's such a beautiful way to incorporate what we're seeing in the world whether it's a b c or you know we have Hawks and blue jays and things around here and it's like oh what it was the blue jay energy about today so I really love that I love being able to touch touch nature in that way but I also think even if you use these individual you can take a card of say the hawk and meditate with that card and spend time with them and start to connect with the energy of the hawk through them that card absolutely and kind of a little bit like what both of you were saying one of the things that I use  these cards for was something more bees I'm seeing more possums running around so some of the animals that I noticed around me I look through the back I grabbed a few of those cars and pull them out and had just a meditative moment with those cars and just thought about what I've been seeing and just kind of find a reconnect with my land and with the energies around me and so that was a very beautiful just to read what those cards meant hold them with purpose and shows them and they still connected to meanings things I needed to learn and maybe some other animal cards that she wanted to work with and seeing how that correspond to tarot and bring that into her life magically that way I think it said you know any place where you may not get animals right here in New York City and the things you see are dogs and cats and this is the way to be able to pull a card every morning and connect  animal energy and connect with the Earth and then I need to bring bring it through this way to is because sometimes people have a hard time connecting with visuals of other people nice or depending on body shape or depending on gender identification culture yes and so it's another way to put a bypass all of those things and still be able to connect with with the tarot on Oracle and I loved how you mentioned you know people who live in the city or you know there could be a lot of reasons why you might feel disconnected from Mother Earth why you might feel disconnected from the and so working with a deck like this that really kind of pulls you outside of yourself and brings you to that natural world even you know even if it is just through the cards I can really help kind of bring that energy into your life I love that you know even if you're not a big huge City like New York or Boston you know I've never seen a rhino  it's not for my region but when I saw that the Rhino was the tower I was like oh yeah that makes a whole lot of sense but I almost feel that Tower energy when meditating thinking about that Rhino I see how that is absolutely a perfect fit or like the hummingbird I see how that is an absolute perfect fit for the star it just some of the ones I'm familiar with at least on a small level I'm like oh yeah now that I see that she pointed that out totally makes sense but then thinks I'm less familiar with I'll be honest with you I don't know but I know the night of water so then I'm like okay well let me try to connect to eat you know so even if it's noon you can connect with animals that are not local to your region even if you're not  in the big city bright and because you know the tarot when you see those animals you're automatically going to understand that there's something about that particular card that is part of the energy or the easier or something for the animal whether or not you read the book right right because like I said you know I just would rather get to know the cards and learn it that way and not make my self feel ancient have to get out my bifocals go get them you got to read it. Going through it a lot of them were like oh I said makes perfect sense or some of them I never thought of before where there any animals or any energies that came through here like I need to be this car do you notice anything that really spoke to you I think there was one of the fun ones that I thought was a unique when was the egg for them for the eighth of wind  normally it's a sword it's that single sword and it's sharp and it has this Vibe right where as the Ace of wind is is little eggs in a in a mess and a genin of the suit and its it just felt very different not as blunt as what were used to be one of the ones that I really love with the vulture I have been saving that image from before round two of the cosmic seed cuz I'm an image of collector because he know a lot of my work is digital Allah so I do have a few know you'll see every single card has hand-drawn little white tattoos little pretty doodle I love that on the magician which is a crow do you have the elemental symbols drawing down his back I thought that was what was one of my favorite so I left that my first one with the elk the elk was my first creation  what was the emperor Empress is a bear with her Cubs I love that yes I had fun with that one I like the silver back for the king of a Silverback ain't the king of the earth I don't know who it is things that made me think like the the bonsai tree for the hierophant that made me look at that card I normally have bad associations with that card that normally doesn't give me that it's not it's not tradition to me so much as the negative aspects of tradition find that aren't good you know the things that you follow blindly I know it has more meetings than that but that's as a bonsai tree you know that wisdom that taking your time and patience that learning and growing and in a beautiful way it just really made me see that differently was there something about choosing these that did  just got on well I'm just going to draw this or did you ever do any type of ritual or any type of medication or any type of work too kind of to come up with an answer or did they all just come pretty easily and intuitively it wasn't some of them came and they were and I just knew like this animal makes a makes sense because I have to do deep research on I like the familiarity of the lion being strong because he been in traditional cards even right away Smith you see that lion and strength and I was like super super obvious ones that was interesting for me to find with the hyena I was having a hard time with that when I was like okay I had done so many by that point and there wasn't tons of them feel like there's tons of animal options left and I was looking for something and I was like okay someday I need somebody whose skill full full that way  they do and isn't already one of these other amazing animals that I've already selected and so when the hang that came up I was like I kind of felt do I really want to do the hyena because he's he's also somebody who's going to come up and eat you if you can but it was so perfect and this one that I found this beautiful image that I found was perfect for the card and so sometimes it was surprising what ended up coming through and deciding to or the decisions that were made around certain cards another one with the flamingo it's one of my favorite cards in the deck it has it's one of the only ones that has multiple animals there may be a handful of them that has more than one animal but there was something about having these six flamingos for the six of wind  flying through the sky and I just I'm so moved by by that image that's beautiful it sounds like you connected with just as many animals is I did through the stack and connections with each of those individual Spirits at my house I cried you know we just talked about the animal aspect of it but was it more difficult for you to choose plant because you know we kind of have this notion of animals in animal behavior when you were looking at the hyena to B spoke to that particular card was it more difficult to find the plants that you used I mean Layla said before the poppy was obvious but I saw a yellow Lily plant Spirit as well do you feel ill somewhere or something obvious like the the Lotus kind of came through of course the Laurel for the six of  wander the six of fire those were things that kind of just for like yeah this is makes sense the Ros for the lovers right so some of them were simple like those things in and others I had to say okay it's been a while I've made a lot of animal that's quite a few insects in here but I haven't put you know as many plants as I'd like it so I'd have to kind of stop and think okay well we're going to plant go and because of all the beautiful metaphysical properties through all of the Pagan is materials that are out there I was absolutely able to find all those correlations that I needed I love the back of the deck when I opened it the stack it has Leila knows the name of it I know it it has a plant on the back of each card and when I opened this my first thought and you're going to laugh Layla my first thought was Layla hahaha  used to have two of these plants in her living room they're big and obnoxious  Lalo's house I'm going to remember that and they are beautiful and yes I do have I do have a couple but that's okay we won't talk about them trying to eat she'll when she comes over in this sack as well you also have a Tarot layout this one's a little simpler and this is the life overview spread and I like how it's almost in an in a spiral starts in the center and moves out in a little bit of a gyro is there anyway that you would like to work with tarot not just for insight do you like to use it as an active magical tool like to ask for something or manifestation or spell work or anything to do you like to work with Heroin that way in any way but you know what I haven't actually and that's interesting to think about generally I just use it for readings I used to read for other people in my  and I realized that I prefer not to have to do that it's a lot of energy to give I loved it and I and it was fun and I I still will like do an event like sometimes I'm going to be like hey we're doing an event we need someone who can come in for 4 hours and then I'll do something like that but I like to just read for myself or for someone close and take my time and go and read the book and think about what I'm what I'm thinking it might mean and go back and forth and really kind of just take my time with the reading and I generally just use the use it but use it with spreads but I have seen some really cool books for people are using it for all these different ways of working as a book about that I'd have seen that there's all these unusual magical ways to use Terrell and I don't know much about them but I think I'd be interested in  Lenny where I love how it is such a beautiful tool for yourself psychologically it's it's wonderful to get ideas about the future and to talk to you now opens conversation I think it's just such an amazing tool for anybody to have some thank you for creating this one as an animist myself I love the ties to the earth and the ties to the animals in the animal energy so it's fabulous. So thank you thank you and that just makes me more excited to see your next week  do you have any other things coming up any places where people can find you or find your shop The Miz Weaver is still available as a late pledge option and so for anyone who's interested in checking that out you can go to Kickstarter and just search mythweaver that is what I have that sticking going to be taking my focus for the next few months and I'm excited to get that out like I said at the end of the year I already am starting to how images Bubble Up in my head around the next following day back but I'm going to just kind of see you know sometimes I think I know what's going to happen and then it's a year later and it's something completely different so so we'll see but I know that this is my life my life is I'm also a silversmith and I'm a Creator it just in general so I'm always making something but it's so fulfilling to create tarot and Oracle decks  and so I just feel like part of my life's work and I'll definitely be doing it for sometime glad this is your calling because we love them so thank you thank you thank you so much I really appreciate you coming back on and we are going to have to have you back for the next deck just remind everybody where can I find you online and I'm socials yes I am at the cosmic seed on Instagram and you can find my website is a cosmic seed studio.com thank you thank you so much for listening to you this episode of back on the broomstick and thank you so much for joining us on this episode to talk about magic and Earth wisdom as well as for new deck if you like this episode please give us a like some Saars it helps with a Twisters find the show and it makes me feel and I can't collect little witches so until next week  be Wicked and keep it with you

someone who's offered to help because they have heard us mention before that it's just the two of us and oh my gosh I love the idea of having a little bit of help is not professional by any shells in a bathrobe I'm in my basement we just hang out and talk about witchy things to each other and love having all of you guys along for the ride but we have real jobs and other things outside of this is kind of just a hobby this doesn't make us any money we don't we don't have any training in this be kind of learned all of it on the fly so we're having a ton of fun with it don't get me wrong but this is just too very adventurous newbies you are so humble cuz you are the biggest techno-geek and you know I am the comedy here like you  you are the Techno princess and queen thank you myself and all the listeners appreciate everything that you do an awesome job that we have done a techno which is kind of out here on the airway a question question is from Sabrina she says that she's fairly new to Witchcraft she's been soaking in all the information that she can practicing small things here and there she says that our podcast has been a big part of her journey thank you Sabrina we appreciate that one of her children will be going on vacation with her sister and her family soon he's never been away from her for that long and she would like to do a protection spell for him as well as the rest of them she does trust her sister I get it I guess sisters I totally get it but you'd be more at ease if you could give them a little extra protection I guess  nothing wrong with being a mama bear and wanting your kids protected your sister her family she's asking do we have an easy protection spell for beginner witch absolutely we've got you I know you got something up your witchy Slaves Shall and I have a couple ideas of things that we do in my family I love trinkets I love things I must have been a fairy in another life I am all for carrying crystals I am all for amulets whether that be in the form of a necklace or a ring or whatever I do like temporary body art a henna tattoo of a Sigil you know I know that doesn't necessarily work for everybody and might not be appropriate for small children but that's generally my go-to this if I were in this particular situation my daughter went away to school several years back Jesus she's a full grown adult now but she had gone away to school and I had  coffin nails and put them in her car to protect her when she was driving back and forth from school because she was about an hour and a half away from home so I'm big on amulets or crystals or something magical like I said the coffin nails whatever works best for you sing with coffin nails is they were used to create spiritual barriers and ward off negative energies entities in influences some people would put it on their property or or bury it somewhere on the property but it can also be used as a protection in a ward in a barrier in your moving car magic and I know I'm a lot of Appalachian Traditions as well as other food conjurer other type of folk magic Traditions as well but particularly in Appalachian magic I know that one of the men  uses of coffin nails is for protection so letting them in a vehicle makes perfect sense something like black tourmaline for protection with maybe a Sigil on it I love that you said trinkets because that's exactly what I was going to say to my family travels a lot my children travel we travel together so we actually have specific trinkets if we're all going together will usually each carry a trinket with us that we've carried before one of them in particular it looks like a small coin and it has a tree on one side and on the other side of his family we have like four different things that will use but that's one of them that will use we almost have like this little tradition where when we are saying goodbye to the person who's leaving we will make sure one of us to give them one of the trinkets that we have charged in the past with travel protection and because we've used them so often we don't even need to  beautiful ceremony with those anymore just the familiar ceremony of saying goodbye and giving someone the protection trinket is enough to activate the spell because I got medals jewelry crystals tend to hold spells very very easily you can even involve a child in that if there's a trinket that they like even a teddy bear or a blanket will hold a spell for a short. Of time or if you can put a not around like maybe a scarf around a teddy bear or not in a blanket to hold a spell that can be a very simple way to charge an item with protection for someone who's okay you know I'm famous for left turns I totally need I I need to interrupt you and stop you and take a left turn love it where we going okay this is another case of how you and I are so damn simple it's frightening so you said you had a coin with a tree on it and what does what does it say on the back family okay funny story so  my sweet love we actually it 1.7 years ago when we were not living together got coins and I have it right here on one side is a tree but on the backside mine says may you know nothing but happiness from this day forward it looks very similar to mine we are too so when you said that I was like oh my God ever treat going to we have a few of them that we use for a little and we still do it and again it's kind of part of a little bit of a ceremony and when I think it was kind of chosen we would do a ritual little spelled charge it specifically with protection but again because they've been used so many times for that we don't really need to do that anymore you know sometimes it's not necessarily a thing or a trinket it can be just just a idea or a thought because you know sometimes bother you  you know my sweet love and my children at nausea I am one of those people that I don't care if it's in your face and I know damn well you see it I am going to be hey look at the Moon I'm literally one of those people and I would drive my kids nuts especially cuz me and and every night look at the Moon kids both of my kids have told me that there's been times cuz you know all three of us actually live in three different states that they felt safe when they looked at the thought of my arm so sometimes it's a thought more than a trinket or what-have-you I taught my girls a charm when they were very very little and it's dumb it's the dumbest rhyme ever are fire and water this house is safe safe for Witch's Daughter makes no sense right and you know we have this little thing song You way of saying  and I've done that with them since they were very very little you know when they would go to bed and they were scared of there's a monster under the bed or the Boogeyman in the closet or when the plane was taking off and they were worried about it because we've done that as a charm of protection anytime they were worried even as teenagers and now one of them is in her early twenties they still say that charm the whisper it to themselves or they'll think it over and over in their head if they're walking down the street and they're a little scared or you know if they feel like there's a little bad energy in a space that's a charm that they will automatically go to and it clears the energy immediately again because it's something they've used so often you know it was a powerful charm when they were little it's still a powerful charm now I love and energy before we get off this question I just want to say that this is a wonderful time also to practice long-distance energetic use because learning to use energy on yourself or someone else with  someone else's permission to shield and to use that energy to create an energetic bubble of protection around them is a vital part of working with energy of working with magic and so this is an excellent time to learn about energy to your child you don't have to give them anything you could just say you know every day at 1 I'll be thinking about you and then think about that person and surround the constructs that beautiful bubble of energy around them in light and love and protection and for their best good and then practice that practice drawing that energy up into you and projecting it to that person to give them that protective bubble that protective shield and it's a great way to protect them at a distance and also to help you work with energy in to learn to work with energy more strongly  in a funny story about that I did the same thing with my children growing up and I literally my son you know he was in his late twenties and Laura that pains me to say I can give that boy like that evil mom look from 200 miles away and he sees it home and my mother is just she knows and she's not even here like I can give him that look from a fire there's a bunch of ideas and connected you have a unique energetic connection with this being that you nurtured you raised your grown you have a bond with this person and you can utilize that bonds to send them beautiful wonderful loving energy or to yell at them across distance like Sheldon  this message came from Sandra and she says I have my misgivings with the spirit world do I feel that the veil is there for a reason I was Harry I have avoided communing with Spirits or having anything to do with mediumship is this okay do you have to commune with spirits to be a witch know Sandra do you do not answer the next question so yeah I know you do not have to do anything with mediumship to be a witch none at all I think you should get comfortable with the idea of it but do you have to work with them know this question Sandra you say as a solitary you've avoided communing with Spirits or having anything to do with mediumship that strikes me as worry or fear her and I would hope that that's not the case but do you have to work with them know but I also would not want you to be afraid of them I'm not saying don't work with them because there is a fear there I'm saying you don't have to  if you don't want to but if there's a fear there I would hope that you would maybe learn more about that work with that a little bit you know I think that for people who are reluctant and maybe want to like dip their toes into it and not go off. Contact you now try to connect with a relative that has passed that you had a connection with my go-to would be a grandparent or maybe someone closer but sometimes I think that reluctancy comes from Fear you know it's like the ocean if you don't know what's there and you can't see that it's scary you know it's a very good point I also emphasized that you do not need to if you don't want to he just don't want to for any reason you do not have to work with any type of spirits of people or energies any of that you do not have to work with any of that to be away like that  what's the weather shell and I are big proponents of learning as much as you can I don't want you to be afraid of any of these things we would like you to learn and know as much as you can about it so that you can be educated and make a decision that way rather than through fear and learning and knowing doesn't necessarily mean practicing correct you know I have learning something you said I was like alright moving on you know take the bus leave the rest I say be familiar enough but if you are not comfortable with it and you do not like it then you know what you need to know and walk away and be done mediumship Spirits are different to me than land entities been land Spirits than eat your energies and nature spirits and you don't have to work with them to be a witch either although in my personal opinion I think that would be extremely difficult because my brand of Witchcraft and and what I very strongly believe paganism  and Witchcraft is is very deeply connected to all life to the Earth and two living things into all the cycles of this beautiful wonderful place so I think that would be very difficult but obviously it can be down there are people who do it so yeah you can be any kind of what you want you don't have to work with any energies you don't want to but I do think learning about it so you don't have to be afraid this wonderful and you know I think that maybe the method in which you do it or or give it a try is also going to be key all right so next question is a very short question and I think it has a very long answer words what study would you advise to help open your third eye  third eye is something that came from him it's an idea that came from Mostly Hinduism and Buddhism and it refers to a spot on your forehead just above and between your eyes in the middle of your forehead essentially and that corresponds to it's a chakra the Asiana I'm probably saying that wrong I apologize is a j a n a or brow chakra I literally have always just got out of my head Shakra just saying it's metaphorical and it's called sometimes quote the eye of introspection a lot of people say you have two eyes to look outward and one eye your third eye to look inward when you awaken that I the idea is that you have had a deeply personal and transformative experience that you are able to access insights about yourself insights about personal understanding your place in the universe or at least you know a little taste of that as you start to open up your third eye  I supposed to help you look Inward and it can be very deeply spiritual and very deeply meaningful so activating that can really open your psychic abilities I can open up your your magical abilities that can help you with meditation I can help you with a lot of magical practices so quite a few witches will work with the idea of opening their third eye to help them activate that magical energy and that beautiful insights that can give them access to more of their potential more of their which who sells I guess the last piece cuz I was worried you were going to stay with the introspection part because I have never really utilized my third eye for introspection work that is such a me thing I don't do is shovel says but because I am able to open my third eye  can utilize that to kind of I don't know a better way to say it but get myself there you know whether it be in alpha or in that magical you know it's time to do ritual it's time to the honor or or whatever the case may be that is kind of you know I close my eyes and kind of look out my third into I want to say the magical world but the magical yeah a lot of people especially witches and magical practitioners will use some form of breath work or meditation to activate that third eye and just like you said not to sit there and be introspective and and look at themselves or or do Shadow work although you can do that but more to activate their magical brain and to get into that being able to see those magical currents of energy and feel that that magic is active within you and that you're connected to all of that no  you know read ten bucks get 10 different answers I think for me it really kind of it started with meditation and continually doing things like you know the Crystal Cave meditation think of when when you wake up in the morning in your eyelashes kind of flicker but your eyes aren't quite open yet and then you know he just kind of Peak open I think that consists of meditation is what got my little eye lashes my third eye flicker in and you know kind of waking up the and now I can kind of do it on command so I think repetitiveness what do they say you do something 21 times and it becomes habit meditation is what kind of got me to flicker in that I open meditation and breathwork is definitely a great way to do it so the best way to visualize it is when you're sitting down in your meditating close your physical eyes and then focus on the center of your forehead and some people will even  I believe we did it in the meditation that we posted not too long ago we talked about when you breathe it in imagine that are coming in through the center of your forehead and if you have trouble visualizing that one thing you can do is lay down and take a small Crystal take a piece of lapis lazuli or take a clear quartz and place that on the center of your forehead then close your eyes and as you do the meditation focus on the cool Stone you'll be able to feel it sitting on your forehead the weight of it right there look at it with your eyes closed battle kind of cross your eyes and you'll essentially look at that center part of your forehead and you'll begin to feel it activated just by the weight of that stone and looking internally at that spot and then just start to work with that do your meditations of third eye opening breathe and feel the breath come through that chakra through that energy center the more you work with that the more you will wake him that I it'll start to become very easy you'll be able to do it on command  but sometimes it's easier to have a crystal there some type of physical sensation to help you visualize the no political visualizing not physical I now Dynasty then what peace and I think they done what piece is really up to you as an individual you get to that point where you literally feel that I open what do you see where does it take you and never took me to introspection that is a shell issue apparently but maybe it takes you to a different magical place maybe it takes you to communicating with Spirit you know you got to figure out what that looks like for you when you know what do you see in the morning when you open your eyes the same thing what do you see when you open that I I can't necessarily tell you what you're going to see when you open that I cuz it's probably different than what I saw what you saw or what the next person is going to see  how do you say you just got to open it and kind of work with it and get a feel for how do you feel where do you feel you're at you know you feel like this is a work on yourself or greater magical workings for me it feels more like Awakening my active magical brain Awakening that part of myself that is in touch with allergies and end with currents of magic and so opening that I allows me to see those energies and to see that magic much more clearly I'm going to say something that is so unexpected that may this might be something you should Journal oh my god did I say that yes you did say that making you more wise  I I wouldn't say you should record this cuz I may never say it again but I definitely think this is one of those things that might be best journaled because it is a process and you may have a different experience each time is your your opening that third eye so it pains me it kills me  if you are into smokable spells make yourself a little smokable joint little cannabis maybe a little blue lotus that when you do your medication put you lapis lazuli right on your third I have a few puffs of your herbal spell lay back and have the idea of opening that third I just look at the crystal that's on your forehead and that'll help you visualize that and like she'll said afterwards Journal everything you felt journal what you saw a journal the things that you thought do that for which you say 21 days 21 days after that discontent and she was looking for spiritual connection like a lot of us too and she kept being pills back to Witchcraft because witchcraft is amazing so I'm not  all the things looking for experts and sound back on the stick which were very happy for we're so glad you're here she's as I feel like you're my family not wise Auntie since we are the same age but really cool cousins I'll take it for your cousin's Samantha's having a little bit of trouble with an insurance company insurance company suck right person she wants to know if she should try a binding spell to prevent an aisle or something like a Prosperity spell to Grant her request and is wondering if we have any insight she also says if we ever decide to host a retreat or a seminar back on the broomstick boot camp for beginners she would totally be in so I can't say we haven't talked about it there's nothing to talk about it okay so I have to start off with don't ever listen to me cuz I am a crazy Gemini but I understand that you are thinking of  binding spell for Prosperity spell Layla we'll get to that in a minute really should start off with the Itchy ass. This is a tri-axle spell I'm telling you insurance company itchy ass will spell step to you know I'm almost torn because I like both of her ideas but I will say this I try to keep finding these two special occasions for is I like to call him the super douche has the pound to the whole world I would say maybe focus more on the positive outcome part of it because you also got to remember kind of negative breeds negative and you know again we don't want to be bound to everybody on the planet here I slightly disagree with shell and not because I have a problem with Texas I mean expeditious by all means they deserve it  and that when I kind of don't agree with either let me explain why or is he asshole spelling large entities is really difficult it is you know it yourself that's right we've all heard about the tick tock witches who cursed the moon and we've all heard about people who tried to curse various political entities we keep trying but very often are difficult we have to have realistic goals here people write insurance companies are very very large if you have the name if you have one person at that insurance company that is holding you up and you know specifically who's doing it. She has whole spell you'll be a tri-axle spell buying them throw them in the freezer whatever you need to do to stop at persons however insurance company is a whole are very large entities and think of magic like pushing things if you're going to push a stone you can throw that fucker really far you would chuck it across the lake if you want to  I could not Farm you can throw that stone really really far exactly an insurance company is more like a boulder yes you can push that Boulder but it's going to take time it's going to take my meds some it might take tools it might take friends it might take a lot of energy so I'm going to say save your energy for other things don't try to hex the insurance company what I'm going to say is do a road opener spell do something to ease the way for you and to open doors that might otherwise be closed so I would Envision a door opening spell literally stand in a doorway hold the handle of the closed door and stayed out loud all obstacles borrowing my way to health to unburden health to help without financial obligation she'll be gone and open and an open that door with force and say so be it or so it is or by my will something strong powerful as you open that door do that  do a traditional Road opening spell if you want to I wrote opening spell and a lot of Latin America and Caribbean Traditions Road opening a specific to those cultures but if the idea of that type of spell is to open the way to remove blockages opens doors that's why the opening doors spell I just mentioned could work really well but the idea is to allow energy to flow smoothly and clearly towards your goal so that's probably what I would do here for this type of working after you do the hopefully it'll land on the right person and that'll help and then do the door opening spells to clear the way for you and for your health and for your goals and that way it brings the focus back to you and things that you can control and your energy being open rather than trying to stop a very large Boulder by yourself definitely thinking this situation kind of working on  your path clearing your way is the less energy sucking to be honest with you set your intentions during a new moon work on spells as the moon waxes to grow your health to grow cooperation with the insurance companies and then on the full moon when that power is at its highest and its fullest and at its most strongest strength then do that spell and open the door and let that energy to flow Samantha I don't like insurance company a tri-axle spell so hopefully everything works out well for you and you get what you need we hope the best for you and that everything works out well they're all right so answer the next question OK Google one more and it's a little bit of a long one but a good one so this is from Kimberly and Kimberly rights  so I've always been a big ol atheist but I really feel like I'm supposed to be working with Venus right now in retrospect she's always been the embodiment of my spiritual self but I never really called it that before I gave an apple spice to the ocean the other day oh my God I love that and put a pink candle and some red flowers on my altar at which point two doves appeared outside the window where my Alternatives but how do I actually work with Venus to accomplish anything hold that thought there's a little more so that seems like kind of the first part she continues to write I am already happily partnered and a mom so I'm not super interested in that aspect of Venus hey totally get it but she adores the passionate slightly androgynous but very firm mother goddess parts of Venus Venus has energy and bringing abundance and luxury back into her life again and to help her achieve her creative goal  towards that end she also wonders Venus is very Mediterranean but Kimberly is Hawaiian on the other side of the world she's wondering if it's even accessible for her to get that Venus energy I'll get to that in a minute that I think I have a long-winded answer for but she wanted us to discuss Venus and ways to work with her or even go into detail on what it means to work with any particular goddess and how to do it she also says that were amazing and you know what Kimberly you are amazing and we appreciate you writing to us okay so Laila on the backtrack just a second so she put out the Apple slice in the ocean put a pink candle and some flowers on her alter but she's wondering how does she actually work with Venus so we'll start with that particular question first beautiful you already are you just did  instinctually however you found that information you know how to work with Venus she loves fresh flowers fresh fruits luxurious Cent music Beauty rituals rituals of self love and care that's perfect and the production is you know she said that she's already partnered in a mom so she's not interested in those particular aspects of Venus but is interested in other aspects to that I say you don't have to necessarily love or be a be tied up and every single aspect of every single deity that you work with that's unrealistic so you know maybe at one phase of time you are into the fertility of love and compassion pieces of Venus and then maybe at another point in your life you know it's maybe that the mother asks  EXO Venus like people evolved DD's evolved you know like I said before take the best you know leave the rest if you are not into the sexual aspects of Venus and that what she represents fine work with the mother aspects thing about Venus and other Roman goddesses is they very often have other names to honor different parts of them so I know that a couple of Venus's names are Venus Felix or her lucky ass back to you can pray to her for good luck Venus genitrix for her aspect as a mother the mother of Rome Venus murchie I guess because of Myrtle because it's Aunt Myrtle is sacred to her so I don't know what to think about that one but that's one of her name and Venus victrix because she's also the goddess of Victory so you can call to her I'm one of these names she has other names as well so you can call to her specifically would one of these names talked to her in that aspect  you want to you do not have to just worship her as love and beauty but like you said in your message you like the mother goddess the passion the luxurious Miss of her those are all foundational parts of her that are absolutely wonderful to call upon and to honor in worshipping her because there is a lot of love and beauty with being a mom you know maybe it's not the traditional way you think to work with those aspects but just put it into the perspective and how it relates to you and your particular spot in life that's what I would do but this next one so she sang Venus is very Mediterranean and she is very Hawaiian how do you make this work so hey Layla river that time way back when when I spent like a year working with Pele Kimberly might have heard of Pele before you know I think people connect with  allergies and DVDs in a way that there is no time and space there's a lot of a lot of answers to this imma let you in but I don't feel that when it comes to working with deity time and space play a part in this that makes sense to bring this back just a tiny bit to the beginning of your email Kimberly you mentioned being an atheist I'm kind of an atheist myself I don't I don't believe that the entities are actual human like beings that walk around I don't I do feel that they are energies there are aspects of humanity aspects of nature aspects of the world end of life and the universe that through a lot of different ways to become Siri like I literally just covered the ears on my account a statue just so you know I'm going to really twist your brain because I do believe  and deities in that way if it they are energies that they have ideas and will and force this is a whole other episode cuz I don't believe that they are actual being nice but I also believe that they are actual energies and entities so we'll get into that some other time because I think I have a totally different View and I would love to have this conversation however because of that I do believe that these energies that these entities are Universal ideas and learning about Venus if you feel drawn to learn about her learn about her that means she is calling to you find out as much as you can about her there is a wealth of information about Roman deity is particularly Venus they're very popular get a little statue so many books and information out there that you can find and and I think that's part of the fun and part of the worship is learning as much as you can about these deities what works for them and finding what works for you with them  that's part of the joy of it and that doesn't matter where you are or who you are in a lot of cases if this is not your culture of you're not Roman maybe you wouldn't want to say that you are an expert in in Roman deities and go around saying that you are now a high priest of Roman deities and you're going to teach everyone the ways because that's just not it but learning about it we're shipping out on your own finding that relationship within you that works for you and for your practice absolutely go for it so I would also add and I'm also a fan of a good statue if it were me would get some things related maybe and have those things on your altar for example you know with the Conte I have a statue I have some keys I have a little thing I made look like a Crossroads I have a statue of a like or sacred to her or or are associated with her  and I have those things on my altar to kind of bring her to me because well I can't go to her right now your question about what does it mean to work with any particular goddess and how to do it you know for sure it's Gathering those things and creating an altar to them and creating a practice and working with them and for me it starts very much with learning about these theories and I do a lot of reading I like to research them as much as possible I like to look at rituals and spells that people have done shortly with this deity and I I like to journal hot of it how I feel working with them what resonates with me about their stories their myths their folklore and through doing that it becomes very apparent what feels right just like you did Kimberly with your reading in your research you offered her fresh fruits that felt right to you that's something that you learned about her mythology that works for you and you felt the energy of that and you saw that with the two doves  set a do you know what a beautiful symbol of Venus with doves mate for life and are so adorable that way and I know I'm a weirdo but with Hecate it was more like conversation is like I know you you're such a bookworm and I love you for it but it was almost like those meditative conversation is like like we were talking on the phone like bestpals getting to know each other and she was whipping my ass into shape but I kind of more have like those Spirit conversations that I can save you read first communicate later I communicate first read later and sit down in the meditative space have a lit candle that you can focus on in a journal right there and asked if he had any questions or talk to them you know hey Venus how's it going with messages if you got for me today  and then no matter how silly it feels just write down whatever you feel write down whatever comes to you or just remember whatever comes to you mean you probably won't you should write it down know I remember sometimes has given me the mamluk before you go remember those things but have that conversation and write it down how does it feel talk to that deity surround yourself with things that remind you of Venus you know beautiful fabrics and sends sensual music venous Lake and then talk to her what messages do you have for me and then just write it all down no matter what it is write it down or pull your tarot cards are your rooms or you know I probably need anything I was just going to say we all know I'm not a super fan of Oracle decks but remember that goddess Oracle I have that you got the  I like using those cards as well for connection pull the Venus card and focus on it what do you see what do you feel you know was it make you think of it all those things down and and do that regularly I'm from Venus you could do that every Friday you don't do that every Friday in the summer when you feel sensual and beautiful and just try to see how that goes and also spend that time researching and learning if you reach out to some people that work with Venusaur that work with Roman deities and talk to them find spaces online where people are talking and discussing these things but for me it's a lot of education and Hands-On work with the things that they like and with that energy and please give me a book man and I'm so they're all right so one last question and this was posed by our Facebook discussion group we have the back on the broomstick Gresham Ford group run by the incomparable Helen  JoJo who is it and this is a fabulous group of witches who have all sorts of amazing questions I'm so sorry I haven't been on lately I've been having a little bit of a Facebook phobia rash I don't know Facebook gives me a rash lately so I haven't been there much but I hear that there's a question about we did an episode back in the first year that we were on about AI is there magic in a i and a couple listeners were concerned about what our stance was on a I particularly in light of the environmental costs and the idea that the AI is a thief and steals art so we wanted to talk about that a little bit and to address that just for a moment I would like to start off we've always talked about how you are way more in the know on techno stuff that I am and I didn't realize and I I don't think I realized till after we did that first episode  environmental impact of AI and it was fell out of my chair when I found out I'm like what the hell is going on so I'm not I'm not using that as a defense person but I think when we had that first episode and I was blowing over a I I didn't realize what that meant at the time so when it when people talk about the environmental costs of a I use what they're talking about is water and a I like a lot of other things relies on servers and the servers put off a great deal of Heat and the water is used to call these down and it's activated that's a chat CPT for instance uses about half a liter of water for every 100 words It produced which is a lot but keep in mind however this water is not lost it evaporates and it's reused so it's a closed system so they try to reuse a lot of that  it's still a lot of water and it still high and then fire mental cost I'm not trying to excuse this I'm just trying to tell you what it is now keep in mind that to produce a pair of jeans it takes four thousand liters of water so that's about eight hundred thousand words of a I again I'm not trying to excuse or make any judgments here I'm just explaining so that you can have an idea so I'm not saying that there isn't an environmental impact there is but I also think that it has been overblown for a lot of different reasons it's still not good and it's still a big part of why my AI is extremely limited I have even turned it off on Google make sure that you know what it's doing now when we first started with that episode I was not aware of how artists felt about it or what was happening with art back at the time  why was New back then was the other thing it's changed since we did those episodes has changed so much it is not even remotely the same it's so much different but I've had several conversations with all sorts of different people about Ai and the theft of Art and that is also a big concern there's also the idea that learning somebody learning or something like a computer or a i learning about art and then creating art is not that fast in NC that's what you and I were doing a i itself was trained on Art of famous artists and stuff like that comes back to is training on Art stealing art and I don't know I don't know there's a lot about AI that I don't know and I'm someone who is exposed to a i quite a bit full disclosure my husband works in a very high-tech field  so he works, we're both Geeks and so as part of his job he has to keep abreast of a i and its capabilities and so he works with quite a few of these regularly so I see it from a little bit of a different aspect does it still bother me yes have I disabled it on Google yes is it something that I have stopped using regularly yes because I am also concerned so it's here may is here is getting bigger and better at an exponential and kind of scary Pace who's in The Terminator having a baby right now and it's kind of 2025 so I think not knowing about it is not going to stop it and it's detrimental but I think there's a possibility in the future where people will have to I think it's going to become a bigger and bigger part of society and so I think we all need to kind of figure out  how to best deal with it if we want to cuz I don't think there's any stopping it so if we did talk about it we did talk about is their magic and Ai and something that can aggregate information and I can help you learn information that quickly I think there's benefits there I think that could be very interesting there's also danger of having just one voice you know if you do a Google search say Google still is kind of controlling what you see but at least there's a whole bunch of different information if you do an AI inquiry it's just one voice it's just one set of information although now there are some where you can get all of the sources that they use to find that information so I don't know this is a big complex question but what I can tell you is that it's not something that I think she'll or I use regularly if at all but I don't know I'm not someone who hates a I I'm not and I I think I can see a lot of good uses for it so  I don't know is the best I can answer that no it's not something that we use right now yes it's something that I think has a potential to be extremely dangerous and cause huge problem I also think it's something that could do great things to so I don't know I'm not smart enough for that question I'm still looking into it you know I know the answer the question but we live in a world that is ever-changing more rapidly than ever has and our lifetime and we're pretty old we may have an opinion about something and then learn better know better find out better and change our opinion so you know I know that folks go back and listen to old episodes but this is a good example of yeah we had a conversation about it and then we kind of learned a little bit better not that we are really knowing a whole hell of a lot about it but we learned a little bit better and  so this is a good example of how people can kind of change what they what their views are in changed how they think about certain things are topics when you know more and learn more and kind of grow more so I don't think it's necessarily we went back and forth on the topic I think it's more we learned more we grew more and now we know more you know when that's life right now you know yeah and even with that was something like this topic you have to keep learning it's not just learn a little bit and then be done this is changing all the time and so we're constantly taking a new information on computers came out and I need to get on the bandwagon but it was either like you leave or learn computers are you get left behind and I kind of feel like that's the way it is with a i you got to get a custom the world is going to leave  behind I don't want that either because I have a little bit of a peek behind the curtain I do see in scientific research and in some of these applications AI is doing amazing wonderful thing it's also the Terminator it's also the Terminator it's also putting people out of business is also making the same answers in the same things over and over again making weird art that keeps people out so I don't know that I don't know so I keep trying to learn as much as I can I guess is all I can say I'm still learning and still trying to figure all of this out just like the rest of us are we love you so we're learning we're trying to figure it out yeah I'm worried about the environmental impact but I'm worried about the environmental impact

it's great and it's fun and I love it I'm not addicted at all but this is not your day it's a day for everyone who loves tarot I do find it ironic that it's within the vicinity of my birthday I am actually not surprised at all that is coming up the same week as your birthday this episode not only  is it right before World tarot day which is every year on May 25th it is also right before World shell day which is on May 31st world is a huge thing and this year it is the biggest most amazing most wonderful thing my besties birthday comes up the end of this month I'm going to be only numerically so the 31st is Michelle's birthday and the 25th is World tarot day so just kind of be celebrating neither here nor there and we've been celebrating I think the biggest thing that I wanted to point out the folks  people surprised I'm surprised maybe I shouldn't be but I'm surprised a lot of people as I didn't realize that was founded by a person named Den Helder in 2003 and she is a Tarot reader from way back and apparently she got tired about hearing all these negative things about tarot back in the early 2000s episode I saw several people invites and demons and is evil and and is just a path to hell so yeah those ideas are still out there on the highway to hell in a handbasket tarot cards shaking all my decks with me right so then she did an interview for the Americans are Association about this day and she said that she really wanted to celebrate sterile and wanted a whole day tours  and to celebrate quote love for this tool and get over our differences you know seriously if they to get over it really I think I really need to meet an elder because we're on the same wavelength there should be more days in the year so we're with your dad at least there's this one I'm happy to celebrate it you know what the heck made up holidays I'm down so what are some of the things that you can do to celebrate World tarot day then herself has a couple of ideas that were published in an interview that she did with the American terrorists sociation I'll post a link to the article but I give a friend or a complete stranger a tarot reading I don't necessarily know if I recommend weed strain on your mileage may vary but if you do email us let us know how you could also use the tarot as a meditation to lure contemplates your life's purpose but if your regular listeners of the show you should be doing that already anyway you could also write a short story by  find one or more of the tarot cards which is one of the ways that I was taught to learn the meanings of the cards you could also wear something special symbolic jewelry a design drawing on your skin excetra to pay homage to a court car or one of the suits you could research and learn at least one new facts about the history of the tarot go back and listen to you are episode about Pixie Pamela Colman Smith if you haven't already filled out for you and of course shells favorite suggestion buy a new Tarot deck or trade one with the best see oh my God I have a great idea and a celebration of world tarot de I should get a new deck yes yes you should I think I should do actually I'm going to be on the hunt for a new deck there's been a couple of been looking at on Kickstarter so maybe I'll grab those as a special treat I have gone Against the Grain I don't know who I am anymore you and I personally have talked about this for years here with our folks in the eye  switch talked about it pretty much from the start I am a creature of habit and then I had some strange Epiphany and fell back into the rider Waite Smith deck which I vowed never to do and somehow and I have now ventured out into a couple other Ducks I think I have actively used more decks in the last year or two then I have been 30 years I'm almost surprised myself with the amount of amazing artists and Decks that are coming out I'm not surprised because one of your big drawers you've always said has been the artwork I admit if I see a gorgeous deck I can't resist I like the symbology more so even a pretty deck sometimes if the symbology is just not hitting for me then it's just not a deck for me  but there's so many out there to choose from it it makes it kind of difficult and kind of fun and also I think I have found if I'm in one load I want to play with one deck and if I'm in a different mode I want to play with a different deck and that was never the case before so I feel like almost like the tarot decks and actually using is expanding not what I own but when I'm physically using I found that to be the case as well when I first started reading it was a deck that my grandmother had given to me I think she got it at a thrift store it was tarot the ancient prophecy which is basically a rider Waite clone and it was by Dynamic design back in the 70s and is very pretty it's a very pretty rider-waite-smith clone B Pixies are through the whole thing and I love that sack then I started using one that was a little more stylized call The Lawn to Tara when I started reading water remember that  they look like elves like tall skinny elves kind of that was my reading for other people that I do own it but I can never connect with it but every time I looked at it and it works wonderfully for me to read for other people but when I read for myself or if I read for you or other people that were close to me I would go back to my original rider-waite-smith clone Old Faithful yeah and I still have the original back I love that back like you I go through moods depending on my mood or why I'm reading or who I'm reading for there's Decks that I'll use and I I keep finding that I'm returning time and time again to the witches wisdom tarot by Phyllis Quran with the artwork by Danielle Barlow so much to it and I I love that it's a little different I also love an independent deck this is one bite Aerotek estudios called The Dark Mansion tarot and it's just it's just  beautiful the artwork on it is just very different it's really it's kind of dark but it's got a lot of symbology in it and I like cars that have a lot of images that have a lot of colors that have all those symbols in it you know but I've always felt like you have kind of and correct me if I'm wrong I feel like you've kind of always been more attracted to like I want to say the darker. Like the law and yeah I know it's true it's true but with me really is kind of mood dependent but I always kind of settled back to that Celtic luck and I think that's what drew me to the Allen Cannon Reed witches tarot very Celtic but right now I cannot get enough of la la nina Simone's doc like I just can't or you know if you if you came to me and was like you know how shallow can you post some cards  totally 110% but I don't think this is a deck I would want to use for public readings if I'm reading for people professionally. There's not going to be the deck eyeball right you know that's a really really good point when I'm calling cards for my nightly tarot polite end of all the witches wisdom and I've used it for that purpose so much that the SEC has become very personal to me and I only rarely use it to read for someone else and usually for another person I'll grab a Smith weight back or the lawn Doterra because those are Decks that I associate with reading for other people but using cards and different decks for different purposes is really really smart because it can really help you get in touch with different parts of your brain and different parts of your magical self funny story that we didn't talk about prior that that you just sparked in my brain I have over the years done a couple reading  in relation to each of my children and as you are well aware when they were significantly younger I had bought them each a deck and I have the same decks my collection so if I were to do something for my son if I was trying to either do a reading for him or about him my go-to would be the gummy bear tarot by the way if you have not seen the gummy bear tarot you as hell but that was my son was deck so if I was going to do a reading relating to my son that almost kind of mentally makes that connection because I know that that was his deck where is my daughter had a Alice in Wonderland tarot so if I was doing something relating to her I would be more apt to use my Alice in Wonderland tarot is almost like a connection to her you know what I'm saying with you I have a line to Terrell if you were like a shell could you play me some card so I can get that sticker  because when I see that Londa Tarot deck I think of you so it would almost be like Layla energy because it's the lawn to deck you know but I mean for all three of you obviously I would still use the same deck I use for myself but I do feel like almost like there's a small deck in the public deck you get different connections with them and whether that connection is energetic or interpretive because easier to interpret for other people and some decks the imagery is easier to speak to yourself better you know you might get more understanding internally than you'd really be able to explain to another person I guess I'm a little more weird about it and you know how I am with analogies and I guess that's the best analogy I can think of is I will share my food with you but I don't necessarily want you eating off my plate sure exactly summer super personal feel like like especially you know there's tarot of the cosmic seed  I feel like the connection I have built with that deck is between me and that deck that isn't what other people's energy to be penetrating Smith back I feel like that is more you know how valid Terry and it's for it's not as private and personal in is a different relationship if you know what I mean absolutely and you can build that with your text by using them exclusively for a certain purpose so maybe you have a deck that you only use when you're doing your tarot card pulse or you're doing it for daily journaling or for meditation purposes and you can really build a relationship with that deck where it feels weird to use it for something else or like you do it's so personal to you that it would almost feel like showing a stranger your underwear and also subliminal  trying to get you to buy multiple decks I mean really this is how I ended up with over 200 Ducks what suits me fancy right now what would I like to go read in the public what deck will speak to me privately like I just can't get enough I want more whether you're someone who uses them for divination or not you can use tarot cards for all sorts of different reasons I think they're an excellent way to get in touch with your subconscious they can really help you move past problems you can use them for self-reflection you can work with them if you're magically stuck you can cast spells with tarot cards there an excellent companion for shadow work using tarot cards in your magical practice can take so many different shapes and forms and sometimes using different sex for those purposes can be the news tarot is a component of a ritual absolutely you know the Fool's Journey though the meditation that we just recently put out that type of work you can do by Paul Anka  journaling with that you don't have to use the cards just to Divine the future or to answer questions I you can use them for all sorts of different magical purposes meditation ritual spell work especially but you know that kind of circles back to what I what I was saying about I have a medic and then I have a like a quote on quote public deck because if I'm doing spells and rituals in in meditative work with that dock I don't want other people's energy a part of that you know what I mean and I think any professional tarot reader would say they were private. Going to public dock quickest I'd kind of reminded me of a couple different things if you do use tarot cards to read for other people not only sometimes is it is it good to have a personal back and a public Zack it's also a good idea to protect your deck from outside energies when you don't want it to be picking up energy because of your using exact that's attuned to pick up someone's energy  when you do readings for them it's a good idea to keep that deck covered when you don't want it to be picking up someone else's energy when I was first given my back I was told that I was supposed to keep it in probably soaked but some type of natural fabric I'm not quite so strict about it now but I still like to keep them in a bag or a box or something like that to protect them from the outside energy that was something that you kind of put off on me about 30 years ago that stuck with me a if I'm using a deck regularly I do not keep it in the Box I actually have shout out plug to Laura Tempest eckroth I use the you know the silk bags or you would taught me back in the day before there were bags that fit tarot decks my grandmother gave me a bunch of her old 1970s era silk scarves and wrap them up if you're not  play some rap them up if they're in a box I'm not regularly using them if they are in a bag or silk they are in the in use pile and I do feel that that helps to keep them separate to keep them special it helps to keep their energy protected I also like to shuffle the deck and cleanse it clear it clear the energy before I headed to a client or before I do a reading for someone else you know I'll clear that through and do the energy put them all in one direction maybe one thing I've always done when I've read publicly in between clients I reorder the cards I know you said that you know your right side of up and do your thing I literally reorder them but I also do it like I almost like I don't want to say it like a cleansing ritual but after publicly reading as I kind of do a cleansing ritual and cleanse my back absolute lie and you know you kind of get into a rhythm of it where you do a reading for someone you shuffle through and you just know your  can can clear clear clear but you should do that order them go through a order put them all straight up sometimes in my tarot bags I keep a a little a clear quartz crystal as well that's a great idea I need to ground them a little a little bit of hematite something like that you could you're good so using Terrell in your practice for divination for spell work for meditation fabulous we also really like to do three card poles or one card polls FPL online people tend to do three card polls well I'm here to tell you tarot spreads are where is that three cars is going to give you a surface answer you've got past present future. That's about it I feel like I feel like a three-card spread and you know circling back to  stay awake I'm aging myself here but I feel like a three-card spread is like back in in the 80s when you would be wherever it is school function your friend's house and you can call your mom collect and I'd like to state your name and you be like  you know the collect all things feel like the 3 card spread is like a collect call yeah you're trying to fit a lot of information into a very short space right right right and if you want an in-depth answer you need to spread 3 Cars is great for journaling it's great for kind of giving you a general idea is great for like yes no type questions and things like that but if you're looking for answers you're only getting a part of the story with three cards and so we really like friends or more is better yours last year I had 49 cards in it for your birthday spread while I was 49 I needed a 49 spread that's right I was not doing a 50 spread this year by the way but we do want to talk about a little bit about how to create a terrorist Brad why in the tarot spread good and in my opinion and a present really great to get clarity to go  a lot of information because each of the positions in that spread is like a it's like a part of the story if you have a story like you to read a book the positions of the cards mean something and that helps you to tell the story and so that's how you can create spreads if you can't find one that fits what you need if you know the symbology of the positions not only will that help you read spreads better but it will help you to create spreads if you need to make one for your specific situation actually been creating spreads for a very long time and how it really started was I don't know who created it no disrespect intended but I am so over that Celtic cross spread and I was over at 20 years ago you know every deck you bought every book you read kind of focused on that Celtic cross you know and I felt like it wasn't  really soothing how I wanted to read you know what I mean I was just like well I can just say if I put a card here it symbolizes supposed to put a card here and then Shuffle It Up and lay him down and see what cards ended up in the spots I said that has each position mean something symbology it makes a lot of sense so cards to the left typically are things in the past cards in the center tend to be present for the right time to be the Future car is on the bottom is very often things that are foundational it can be earthy it can be physical Hearts above you are usually dreams and goals they can be ideas and thoughts again it kind of makes sense you know Autumn is your feet and the Earth dreams where you're at where you been where you're going cards that cross you or cards that are in the way again like for like their obstacles  things that are literally Crossing you or crossing your path or blocking your goal so these positions tell a generic story these positions give you more information when you put Cards into them my very first spread that I created was also because I was working with the Celtic cross all the time and I was finding that it just wasn't giving me everything that I needed it has its uses yeah it's in every single book because it has everything it set up with a framework to be able to answer any question that you have the positions in the Celtic cross give you the outline of your answer and the cards that you pull basically fill in the details as good as the Celtic cross is though there's no such thing as one generic outline that will work the answer every question it doesn't always suit the need of why you write the very first spread of it I created was an add-on to the Celtic cross because as I was doing  readings are people I found very often I needed to draw more cards to get the rest of the information and so I created a half moon spread that I did in addition to the Celtic cross with every single reading that I did and basically that was six cards in a an upside-down Crescent to Rising one of the top two falling and then one at the bottom underneath the Crescent know I found especially doing public readings that the Celtic cross didn't fit the message if that makes sense you know when you're when you're reading professionally and you start laying down cards I do for you and I there is also kind of that that little voice that you're talking to you know that psychic thing that Medium thing you know you're hearing part of the message as I'm seeing it in the cards for me it's channeling straight into the back of my head and sometimes that message doesn't fit the cat  Motocross and I found myself back in the day I died on me back the cards after shuffling and right when I would start that spread I'm like no no no no no and I would just start laying them down maybe not knowing us I don't want to send making a spread upon the fly but kind of almost like Spirit saying no I want these cards to be like this and I want the story to be told in this manner and that was really kind of what started me with creating my own spreads the message and that's exactly how it started for me was I needed a little extra out of that Celtic cross and the other thing I wanted to add is sometimes I use the significator sometimes I don't it's almost like the cards will tell me if I need to put a significator card down whether it be for me or someone else I'm reading for and sometimes it just doesn't  when I first learn tarot I was told you had to you had to pick a significator and it had to be one of the Court cards and it didn't always fit it didn't always fit so I stopped using it and it just didn't really work the only time I use significant others is if I want to see if I have a certain intent there are times when I'm like allright I have this specific intent for this reading so I want to put this card down as a significant her to make sure that this reading starts where I wanted to but other than that I almost never use a significator not anymore I used to all the time I do randomly here and there I feel like the decal tell me if I need to you read very psychically there's a lot of different ways to read tarot you can read tarot straight from the book or from memorization absolutely fine by the way yes and use that as a way to get in touch with  subconscious as a way to work with yourself as a way to Grass ideas and thoughts that you might not have otherwise come in contact with it's also just an excellent way to do Journal work you and your journaling good for you you can also read Terrell very psychically very organically you don't even need to memorize the cars you can just pull the cards out and whatever psychic impression comes to you with every feeling say that write it down work with that are you going to get it wrong sometimes yes are you going to get it right sometimes yes but the idea is to work with that thought slow to work with those ideas to work with that magic that energy as it's coming and you'll get better and better at it so you can go from Strictly rules and strictly what the cards mean all the way to using your own psychic ability to go wherever it wants to go and everything in between and you know that kind of  circles back to my my love of different decks because I mean in and I know you know this sometimes it's almost like with with certain decks the images like jump off the card and start talking to you and Mike meaning a side you know like I know these meetings like the back of my hand but sometimes the cards tell me what they mean not what tradition tells me they mean and I think that's perfectly valid I think that's fabulous and that's really hard to do well to be honest like everything in my opinion is practice makes perfect. Yeah and and doing your tarot Paul's daily and working with Taro and working with your own intuition is really going to help you to do that I didn't want to get too far away from tarot spread so because you have come up with a Tarot spread in honor of world tarot day so before we get too far away from talking about tarot spreads why don't you tell us a little bit about this  spread that you created World Tarot deck I feel like last year I kind of made it all about me and did my birthday age spread and suggested the folks that on their birthday do a spread that was in relation to their age I guess that they were turning to kind of give you a a look at the year ahead and if you go back on our Instagram and Facebook you can see a picture and kind of some details on that spread from last year but this year I wanted to do something a little different that wasn't focused on a birthdays another year and this year I went a little different and I don't know if it was the warm streak we had in here in the Northeast for a few weeks which by the way is gone or if it was a Dandy lions are everywhere but I was sitting outside one day and all the sudden I got an idea for a spread and the name of the spread came before the actual  body of it and in such and its flowers of May where will I Bloom and me personally I am trying to make some changes in my life and in trying to kind of switch gears and going a different direction and that was kind of my thought you know all these flowers are blooming where am I blue making you know being a May baby you know Maggie is kind of like my I feel like everybody has their own like reset month of the year and in a lot of people try to do January oh it's a new year reset for me my reset has always been like my birthday and so I wanted to kind of do a reading that is like okay so I know change is coming I want change to come where do I buy blue Michel the beautiful shell flower that I am where it where is shell blooming and that was kind of the idea of the spread came when you are looking  either validate choices or validate directions at your look at at you need to maybe have some insight on where will you bloom and now you've shown me the outline and I admit that when the first picture you showed me I thought was entirely a different thing but only because I outlined it with a marker  yeah and I am a 12 year old boy at heart but I love this friend and it and all the positions follow exactly what we were just talking about with you no positions have meaning I really love this Fred for that so let's go over your spread a little bit and if you're listening don't worry we will definitely put this up on our social media if you'll be able to follow along there obviously play flowers of May where do I Bloom I wanted the spread to kind of look like a flower and you know my artistic ability is lacking best so my sweet darling love and I always got to bring in some big guns for help with design I asked him how can I lay out time cards I don't know what my thing is I like anywhere between 8 and 10 cards Ecards just isn't enough I like 5 to 10 really  404 Calle 18 cards in it spreads is a lot of cards so I was like you know hey I'm trying to come up with this spread and I wanted to kind of look like a flower and actually in the end it actually came out looking like a dandelion even though you and your 12 year old boys self thought it was something different when it was outlined oh yeah show people the picture you first sent me and see what they say will put it up on the Facebook I will twist her arm and make her get her opinion first so I started off with the stem if you are a flower and you are going to bloom you have to start out with that bass that stem that foundation and so I made a little stem and then a little flower of cards above it I like to start this particular spread at the bottom at your foundation so the very bottom card which would be card  one is the route the foundation followed by the next card which would be what holds us up what motivates us followed by what sustains you and those are kind of the roots of of you and what you embody in your change in your growth and how you're going to move forward it all comes down to the stem in The Roots what told me together and in this picture those three cards go straight up just like the stem of a flower and the stem of a flower has the roots on one end it sustains the plant it holds it up and it provides nourishment so all of those things shall captured in those three positions and that's exactly what the stem of a flower does the top portion so I basically have three cards is my stem the top portion the flower part I have 7 cards and I kind of did this part like and  in a traditional left to right manner so starting on the far on the far left I have my first card what's holding me back because you know I'm a traditionalist even though I don't like rules and don't like to admit it but I do kind of get that what is on the left is where you've been and what got you there and what is on the right is kind of where you're headed so I'm on the left I have started with what is holding you back you know what is what is your obstacles and then that is followed by what steps do you need to take to take action sometimes you need a card to kick in the ass you know and that is followed by your truth sometimes that's a difficult pill to swallow and sometimes it's hard for you to come to grips with your own truth and you need the cards to tell you and be like you know what it is admitted and again those three cards like you said are on the left side so what's holding you back  very often things from your past things that you think about things that have held you back before so that's the very first card in the kind of left past type of position and then what steps do you need to take planning sometimes it in your Society of what to do next holds people back tonight that's why I felt that that was a good card to have in that left position because you know what steps do you need to take you need to get over the hump and do it man right and planning has to happen first planning is one of the first things that you need to do so perfect and then the next card is your truth and your truth again to something also that you have carried with you for a while this is not something that you're just thinking of now your truth is something that has been part of you for a bit from your past so having that in that position also makes sense and it having the is the 3rd card over made sense to me because you know what your truth is not only  yeah your your foundation was built on your truth but your truth is all of it also what carries you forward and kind of yes I love that I love that exactly symbology of position so that fourth card you know where do you where do you dry your energy from that is getting you to the the next phase that's almost like that bridge between where you were and where you going oh I like that I like that you know what I mean what are you feeding yourself that is getting you from point A to point B and not only is that card directly in the middle of the three past and the future cards it's also directly on top of the stem so that fits it almost looks like the top of the stuff the plant so that the energy so we can symbology of position it perfectly fits no starting to continue over to the right my next card what are you drawing into your life  sometimes you want all these wonderful things but you keep consuming your life with bullshit you know what I mean I mean bulshit and I'm bitching about it you know what I mean we do tend to create a lot of our reality not all of it but a lot of it is created by our own desires and certainly our own actions and thoughts so what are you drawing into your life what are you bringing in and what's going to happen in the future for you what are you creating for the future now my next card what to nurture and I think this is important because especially with people like you and I were the last people that are going to nurture ourselves you know where everybody else our kids are our partners our family are friends and we we we don't think of us and sometimes you need to take a step back what do I need to do to get myself from point A to point  what do I need to nurture what do I need to cultivate you know what I mean and I think you start you know you get over to that right side what do you drive again and what are you nurturing are you drawing and bullshittin then nurturing bulshit are you drawing in positivity and in motivation and all those good things so that you are nurturing all those good things energy flows were our direction or attention goes exactly positive positive understand that you don't have control over everything but what are you giving your energy to what are you nurturing when you talk about energy I think that sometimes you can control more than you think by the energy you put into it and then the last card also fits with that thing's coming to you for in the future is also kind of circles back to to what I made  spread what is about to Blossom for you what is your flower that's getting ready to blow all of those are future positions and they fit perfectly but now I'm going to modify it a little cuz you do this to me all the time and I told you what are the things that I saw when you first showed this to me and we talked about it being a dandelion was I also see it that art of the flower can be the dandelion head either in full yellow blue or it also looks to me like the dandelion puff balls so I added one last card to this spread above the whole thing on the right hand side just off-center to be that one dandelion seed puff that's blowing in the wind and that's your wish what is your wish for the future what wish is about to come true for you or what is your deepest wish that you hope to come true and that's what that card symbolizes so that's the  7th optional position  I love this Fred and I love the each position has such beautiful symbology that works together to tell the whole story your idea was where will I Bloom you needed to know you know where am I going to grow shifts Rocky here and I need to be the fucking gorgeous flower that I am where am I going to be home so you created a spread that looks like a flower to match that symbology to match that energy doesn't need to look like a flower yes absolutely fucking time because that's part of the story that's part of the energy when you look at the spread and you see the flower you think blooming you think growing and that's what this is about and so again not just the symbology of each position but the whole or arching spread has meaning and lens that meaning to the reading and that's why it's very important to have the first card you lay down be the bottom of that stuff because  you're starting with your foundation what what is and why is your foundation that is getting you to the point that you are to get you to the point where you want to be and you have to grow from that base so this is perfect and this is a beautiful example of why tarot spreads are kind of important and why the positions have meaning and this is also an example of why the Celtic cross spread wouldn't work for me for this particular thing being able to create something and know why you're putting things in each position makes sense yes you could just lay cards out yes you can just do three cars or you can just start pulling cars and telling a story with them absolutely works perfectly valid but having this Foundation the spaces can make it a little easier for some people and can really give you such Rich Nuance to your readings know I really think it would be funny and I think I'm actually going to do this  first of all I'm just going to interject make a left turn here we all know I love left turns and I have been remiss on social media we understand life has been life and we're getting there but I I really want to post this picture that Layla can see it right now but it's like I'm a piece of paper I had Andrew Little Boxes each random drawing out the meanings but I do actually want to post this because I want to give people an idea of you can just come up with a spread on a napkin paper and if it works for you rock it and that's really the important thing is you have to try these and okay I'm going to take a slight left turn as well do you remember when I made you watch Agatha all along I do and I wish that I watched the whole thing but I was having issues with Disney plus different Missouri  find each position and what they said each position meant and tried it and it didn't work that's why I wasn't your spread it's not that it wasn't my spread I think it was more that whoever put the spread together didn't exactly follow position symbology so it it just didn't work like there was a card Crossing you but that was supposed to be the outcome and it felt off yeah that the last card was crossing the main card and that was supposed to be the outcome but why would your outcome be Crossing you or against you you're already in Gloom direction right from the get-go with just the spread outline exactly so when I tried the spread it just felt off so I worked with it believe he'll and JoJo actually work with it as well love how and by the way how am I worked with it a little bit I showed a version she showed up version and we kind of made it work but if those symbols if those positions don't  please fetch Yer symbology or symbolism doesn't make sense to you than the spread won't work so you have to try them after you create this you have to kind of try it and see if it flows make it a try it I got a little project for y'all I would be so thrilled if some of you all took a little bit of time in your tear ducts and just organic create a spread but what would thrill me more than anything in life is if you share that with Leila and I because you got it in you folks you just you just need to realize that you two can create your own tarot spread that suit your need my wonderful amazing besties

----------------------------------------
welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire where to which you friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your collagen and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a special meditation episode of back on the broomstick I'm Layla and we're sharing with you the DAT calls and meditation from our recent workshop at Sacred Space the Fool's path unlocking potential and possibility and I Michelle and we're going to share with you the invitations as well as the meditation that Leila and I did at the Sacred Space conference in Towson Maryland because we thought that this was something that we didn't want to just share with the participants at Sacred Space we wanted to share this with all of our listeners as well this meditation is basically the Fool's Journey it's the Fool's Journey as a representation of your life it's basically a symbolic Journey from beginning to end and that can be your life that can be a new job that can be an undertaking it can be anything it could be just because you feel like a fool get you exactly because we all feel like we're starting over sometimes and sometimes you need to get in touch with aloe  is that wisdom may be from yourself on a further part of that spiral or yourself from a past curve of that spiral or maybe from the fool who controls the spiral herself and you need a little bit of that wisdom so this meditation is to help you get in touch with that part of yourself that is basically the omniscient fool the all-knowing All-Seeing part of you that knows the beginning and the ending of your story and can give you a little bit of advice as to where you're at right now on that spiral and you know I kind of looked at this also is like like a reset meditation you know we all get to different points in life where there's a little reset and this kind of came you know us formulating this and presenting this kind of came at a beginning of a reset for me and I did look at it as like a I'm the fool starting over in this is my journey here we go  you could even said that walking that Kendall has spiral was like deeply meaningful for you know there's just something about spirals honestly that kind of get me into that going within whether it's you know in my mind or or gaining deeper knowledge or or whatever it may be but that kind of you know down that rabbit hole of whatever that end is for you spirals are liminal spaces to me they seem very inherently feminine and magical and like you said they can help pull you down into that Alpha state or bring you back out of it and it's all about walking that path of life that spiral path we mentioned before that life is not really a straight lines it's more of a spiral and so you're walking that liminal space to get better in touch or like you said to have a reset to find that spot where you can begin again interesting Lee enough you're talking about walking paths let's touch real quick on  we picked the deities for this meditation as well based on the fact that they are Journey Walker's you get from one plane to another from one form of existence to another I guess the idea here that they're going to help you get from your mundane life and cross the Hedge and crossed that liminal space to the inner workings of yourself to that spiral of DNA essentially escort on your journey here along the moonlit path basically is needed if needed that's true or guard you and guide you active guide who's a partner he's a passionate companion he's a team member or he can be that father figure that guard that is stirred protector  whatever you happen to need Alan and Karen Munoz will be able to give you on that path because they're so familiar with it seemed like a natural fit for the deities that we chose and the meditation in the in the purpose of the meditation Ellen there were so many synchronicities I'll link this Sacred Space episode but go back and listen to some of the synchronicities Ellen I think really demanded to be part of this ritual main objective with this meditation was a time and and I think going forward anytime that I look back on this meditation and revisit this it's going to be too kind of  a path to help me face challenges and Trust the path that I'm on so I think that for listeners out there who want to utilize this meditation think about the challenges that you're facing and entrusting your inner self and Trust in your guides and I think that if you do that this is definitely a great pass to get you there with your beautiful voice that is such a meditation voice but still having a guide with you but still having a guide still having that companion it's going to to help you along this path and sometimes that companion is future you or passed you it's the knowledge that you have gained maybe in a past life or maybe in a future life or somewhere on that spiral that's never-ending spiral you're going to find some wisdom and you're going to find the strength  are the courage to take that leap of faith and that's what this medication is for and I think when you come out the other side you definitely get that instant perspective of how wow okay I can do this I I I know what I need to do I know where I'm headed I know the path I need to walk and you've got the tools that you need let's do this that's perfect exactly all right well let's get started so the only thing you need for this meditation is a comfortable place and take a look at an image of the fool card either look one up online or grab your favorite full card from you tear that that's all you need over 200 Tarot deck switch full car do I pick or do I use all 200 plus you closed your eyes been around you grab a Jack and you take the fool card out of that one actually that's a fabulous idea now that you say that  only have a couple decks you can pick one of those are you can pick your favorite image online it doesn't have to be a physical. Just take a look at that card and and remember that it's just time to meditate  before we start the meditation we will call in energies deities guys and Guardians to watch over us Ellen of the ways and Karen Munoz they are both path Walkers their guides and guardians of liminal spaces will ask them to be here with us as we walk the spiral path to meet the fool so prepare for the meditation find a comfortable spot get your image of the full car and Paws here until you're ready to start the meditation  elen of the ways you who guide us on this path of change walk with us through the transformation is Dawn follows Darkness shining day gives way to starry night with the cycles of changing flow we welcome the antlered goddess who rules the waves the roads in the passages of human life both physical and spiritual  and No No's and one Spirit of wildness and Stillness Lord of The Turning wheel we welcome the guardian of thresholds you who stand where paths diverge rain blooded

welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode we have a special guest Natalie labriola Natalie is an artist astrologer and Tarot reader in Los Angeles California her book tarot Timeless secrets of the ancient mirror came out in the u.s.a. this past March and it is a small But Mighty introduction to the Fool's journey of the major Arcana and I'm shell in wow this is you know you even had a line in the book this is a dense informative pocketbook and you aren't kidding so welcome Natalie and please tell us a little bit about yourself and how did you get into tarot and astrology so much for having me I'm really happy to be here with you guys you know I found my way to Tara and astrology because I found myself in a season of life where I was searching for a different way of living and  the tarot kind of stumble I kind of stumbled upon the tarot accidentally I I was at like a museum gift shop I was at The Cloisters Museum in New York museum of medieval art and they had this terror attack on display this medieval Tarot deck and I was just very compelled by the imagery and so I purchased a deck in the gift shop and I just a thought you know this will be kind of like a fun souvenir of my trip or I didn't really have a lot of expectation around what it could do or what the tarot really was so it was just so that was like my first encounter with the tarot and that was when I was in my late twenties the beginning of my Saturn return I have a question ready for that I had a little sneak peek into that because I have read some of the things you've written online you do have a website I think was it a sub stack essay possibly but you meant  that you had found tarot during your your Saturn return your 29 return and for our listeners that don't know what that is that happens roughly when you're about 28 or 29 when Saturn returns to the same position that it was in when you were born and what that does is a ushers in a period of change and self-reflection all the things they've learned all the lessons that you had in your life up to then kind of coming to you and a lot of things happen so I was very intrigued by the fact that you found tarot at your 29 return so I didn't mean to interrupt but I just found that part of a kind of fascinating I know it didn't I mean in retrospect of course it makes sense but at the time it didn't feel you know if it was a hard season and it's funny to talk about it now because like I said in retrospect it sort of makes sense or it feels linear it feels coherent but at the time it felt like just a period of I think several years where I was just searching for answers in  what's my health I was that kind of. Where I had to become more focused on my physical health that was also during my Saturn return and I found out I haven't primary immune deficiency which basically just meant that I was getting sick all the time and that I you know couldn't find a doctor to help me figure out what was going on for many years and so I felt like I was just in this limbo space for several years where I kind of had to rethink the work I was doing which was you know out going to a job you know 5 days a week out in the world and couldn't really do that in a way that felt sustainable to me at that. And I kind of got burnt out on what I had been doing for the past which was focusing on my art and trying to be like an artist and sort of like the art world and and quotes and so just a lot of things kind of came to a halt  and I didn't really know what I was doing or what was it felt like I had to let go of everything in my life or anything in my life that I kind of previously thought to find me and just kind of surrender to this. Of not knowing and I found that the tarot and astrology I tried a lot of different things I mean in addition to like the health stuff that I mentioned it also went on this kind of emotional search spiritual Surge and tried a bunch of different modalities like I learned how to read the akashic records and shamanic journeying and an apprenticeship with Mimi Jung who teaches shamanic journeying and tried a bunch of different things and it just felt like tarot and astrology where the tools that really clicked for me and so terrible in particular was really helpful for just reflecting back  me where I was in that moment and helping me to get in touch with myself in a deeper way you know even though it felt like this kind of long and uncomfortable process which you know doesn't have a beginning and an end it's like feel like what tarot has helped me to be more comfortable with is that feeling of not knowing effort and just asking better questions I like being able to stay with the questions in a different way and trusting my own intuition and in a deeper way so in those ways like tarot helps me to kind of come home to myself in a new way and to just be with the uncertainty of life that is you know I know I've always always being on your own. Journey exactly so I didn't ever think when I found the Terrell  I would end up loving it and wanting to write about it and read about it and study it but and in fact I really like resisted it for a long time because I really was clinging to this idea that like I needed to be an artist in the way that I thought that I needed to be and I needed to and I was there was a lot of what kind of force and so I came here sort of Kicking and Screaming but I am happy to be where I am now I guess but remember what the heck was that you saw in the museum yeah yeah it was Luigi scapini medieval tarot it's I don't know if it's a super common duct but it seems like you have I have kind of sore I have breached I've reached over the 200 Mark of tarot Decks that I own  impressive it sounds like an impressive it's more like obsessive impressive works too I'm sure you can kind of relate to I only use probably out of the 200-plus decks I had I probably only use two or three of them and it's almost like I like to collect the art of them each one universe exactly exactly do you have a favorite deck I have to ask I love that deck it has a special place in my heart for sure and I love that it's inspired by connect to meet evil ducks and those are probably even though I don't use them in readings I just love the art like the visconti-sforza deck is one of my my favorite decks of all time in terms of contemporary decks I really like the Pagan otherworlds deck and I just use the right or wait when I'm doing  thanks it's just you know it's it's kind of basic but it's just what kind of speaks to me the most I think the most clearly and reading it's amazing how well Pixies art comes through Pamela Colman Smith that are just so many people so easily now yeah she really created a map for so many people to follow and speaking of a map when I first read the title of your book time with secrets of the ancient mirror in my first thought was like I'm intrigued about this mere idea where we holding a mirror up to I really like how you bring the tarot internal this is all about working with yourself so a lot of people love to use tarot to read the future or read someone else's future and I love that too that's wonderful but I very much love it for internal reflection for journaling with it for seeing my own patterns for working on the things that I need to work with  and in the introduction when you first start talking about the Fool's journey and you talk about how tarot mirrors your own inner wisdom I just I love that in this is a beautiful map to help you work through the cars and we talked a lot about journaling cards and pulling cars and just looking at what draws you and attracts you and what do you feel about it and how does it make you thinking and really riding through that and the term map was really great I like how you said that that was a good way to put it thank you for that I love the tarot for self-reflection cuz I think it's such a insightful mirror it really you know is such a precise tool for that kind of work and you know I think that you know because the inner and the outer I think our souls are connected in some way I think the tarot can speak to both right cuz there isn't such a hard division so I think that it's a tricky thing because  often I think people here tarot and they think fortune-telling they think being a scam artist or whatever and it's it's not that it can't do that I think that a lot of ways modern no tarot readers maybe try to stay away from that myself included because because of all of the negative baggage that comes with the idea of you know trying to predict someone's future and but I do think that the idea of fate or destiny is more mysterious and we can really understand that you're working with a into something that doesn't it's not like a linear it's ancient and it's also futuristic it's like it's not connected to a linear idea of time and so  in that way it can be till I got in our world our outer World our future are past or present so yeah so I'm I guess maybe I didn't get to explore that as much as I would have liked to in the book just cuz it's so it really had to be you know we don't want to paint ourselves into a corner and say that we're trying to predict someone's future but we also want to leave room for the fact that this is the mysterious force that we tap into and and it has you know reflected future events with Clarity or so many people's I think it's just finding it a way to talk about it that doesn't freak people out or did it freak ourselves out because yeah I mean I mean sometimes it freaks me out when I get scary accurate it's a nerve in my father's really really good and I was definitely  spooked because there's so many synchronicities here we just recently did a meditation ritual we presented at a conference in Maryland and it was the Fool's journey and we we walked a Fibonacci spiral because we talked about how the Fool's journey is not a straight line it's a spiral and you even say that in this book in the instruction almost word-for-word some of the things that the concept that we explored in this in this ritual were that that we are all on this. Any that is a spiral it's not a straight line life is not very often made up of straight talk you can be at multiple different parts on the spiral at one time and other people are on there with you past present future of yourself of them and we're kind of all in this beautiful spiral dance and then I I love how you talked about that in here you said this is not a linear a cent to Greatness but rather a spiraling past holness  almost said those exact words and so I can I love that idea of the full path as the spiral of the Spiral of Life next stop is far as synchronicities so during our Fool's Journey ritual you know I'm a big fan of takeaways I've convinced Layla Layla and crafts for all of the ritual participants she crafted a bunch of different fool cards and the idea and I could exchange it at the end so you know she created a couple of designs on her own but a couple of designs she had chosen off the internet is part of cards that we gave away so we're in the public domain some beautiful cards but I just resonated with tell her the full cards that you chose and how that relates to her book of course  Rider Waite Smith because he's got to love fixing the one card I didn't use was the visconti-sforza although I thought that was beautiful I did use the lefou card from Oswald worth stuck and and also from the polsky deck and on your page of the fool you had almost every single full card there we had used the road in the rest of them out there so I just thought it was kind of cancer is other day it was very cool to open up to the first page with a fool it was beautiful coincidence or friends have been very deep into tarot for decades.  Like I said I have more deaths than any one person really should have and no shame I will buy more but one thing I never got deep into is the aspect of tarot as it relates to the Kabbalah tree of life and that was the very first thing I see when I open up the book so can you just talk a minute about how that relates to Tarot  yeah so to try and be succinct about it because vast subject but to try and be succinct I would say that the tarot emerged from the 15th century Italy right so it has we sort of know its Origins but we don't know there isn't a lot of writing about what the purpose of the major Arcana was or how do the original artist if there was one envisioned it but it does happen to map onto these other systems of thought of you know there's the 12 signs of the zodiac with the ten planets and so that creates a system of 22 which Maps nicely on to the major Arcana and then the Kabbalah has also  there are twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet so there's a resonance with that system and terms of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the major Arcana it's just another lens through which you can look at the tarot and maybe find another layer of meaning I don't necessarily think that any of these things baked into the original major Arcana or the Terra but they're just sort of layered into the book as an offer as an offering of like this is another layer you can add to it if you want to if it brings meaning to you or if that's a system that you're already familiar with then maybe you can connect to that in a different way but it was presented kind of has just like a list of almost correspondences for that reason so that someone kind of wanted to go deeper already knew about it they could connect to it but yeah there wasn't a lot of information  in the book about I guess for that reason is because it would be a thought it could be about it right so it's just kind of like a little to say you are other books about this are there other ways to like learn about this more but it's definitely a fascinating Rabbit Hole to explore and to wonder about and to find connections between but I do feel kind of has its own unique Essence that doesn't match perfectly on to any other system necessarily I understand you are also interested in Appleton Pac magic with symbology and protection symbols and so that I'm not surprised that finding interest in the tree of life and in different symbols of interesting to you but in the book I love that you have like right at the top you have different symbols that are associated with each card and when you talk about  major Arcana cards you packing so there's the symbols right of the top you talk about the numbers you talk about the different correspondences and different things it's like a quick dense guide of information where you might not necessarily go deep into each piece but they're all there they're all right there for your brain to catch onto so you know when I'm journaling and I pulled the emperor having this book right here you know after I get my first initial Impressions and my ideas as I'm you know meditating or working with that card I can pull this book out you know this might give me a whole other Rabbit Hole to go down as I'm studying that card because you have so much information here that you pull out and make it easy to see that's why I love the very last page which is a whole page of Correspondence and mostly gone too and they're they're fascinating how you can layer them on top of different things and to go back to Pamela Colman Smith art just all the different things that she put in there  whether it was from whatever system that she took it from her whoever's information she got it from she layered it all in there they were symbols and there's numbers and things repeated you know the Fool's Journey you see different symbols repeated over and over again and you bring a lot of that here in the end you bring attention to it so I'll do it again it's not a big book it doesn't necessarily in depth but it's right hand tastic reference book when you want to have a guy that might give you more information I told Layla before we started recording that this is like the perfect looked like throw in your backpack you know you might not necessarily bring the big 70 degrees of wisdom but they don't fit in your backpack spreads I also very much enjoy that you included a different spread to help you work with each card more can you talk to us about different spreads and then are there any that you really like to use  yeah I I just started I came up with them based off of questions that I find myself asking not only for myself but for when I do readings for other people as well so I just tried to kind of  think about what are what are the questions that Tara was very good at answering the kinds of questions that Tara was good at answering and what are you do 22 ways to kind of pull those apart and make them into bigger spreads and so I don't think there's anything that the tarot can't address but I do think that there's ways of crafting questions that help you to get better answers and help you to get help you to get what really is the most helpful in terms of actionable guidance for an honest reflection so I tried to just kind of keep that in mind as I was coming up with the spreads as what are what are questions that I asked all the time for myself or other people and how can they be your broadly applied to anyone who might come to this book and want to try to spread for them self  so in terms of spreads that I that I like to use for myself took a question I really tend to craft my questions around whatever is bringing me to my deck to begin with but I think generally the tarot is good for highlighting what is like a challenge what what am I not seeing what is a blind spot you know I feel like it's really helpful for that because that is speaking to you know it's inherently you're asking but what am I not seeing when I was outside of my conscious awareness and so bringing that into a tarot reading I find to be always helpful what is this project missing what is missing from this dynamic between me and this other person or what is what is needed here that I can't see I can't grasp  or questions like you know where should I focus my attention when in regards to this project her just kind of using the tarot to help me or other tap into what is hard to access consciously and using that information to give us some more well-rounded view of a reality because  I feel like that's that's one way that Terrell can be really practical I love the blind spot question I'm going to use that the next time I grab my texts that's fantastic it all you're not always in the mood to hear it but when you are you cannot pray for our listeners who a lot of them love Tarot they're going to pick up this book what would you say they should flip to First where should they start it's not to be so obvious but I would say start with the introduction it's only the beginning just because I feel like that is the one place in the book where you kind of get the zoomed out bigger picture perspective of what is Tara why should we engage with it what can it do for us  what what is a way to approach this tool that can set you up to not be fearful of it if that's a concern or two to just kind of slightly help to orient you to the mindset of openness and receptivity and kind of surrendering control a little bit or surrendering your desire around  what you want to hear or those I think getting in kind of the right headspace is important when whenever possible if possible it's not always possible but you know so I think having that initial mindset kind of is helpful and so I think the introduction might might be good for that so I always ask this of Terrell people because I am very conflicted and I do flip flop so you talk on each page about the reversal meaning I know that when you're writing books you have to kinda comprehensive cover all the bases are real thoughts on reversals when you do a reading for you or clients do you utilize the reversal meanings or do you just kind of read the cards  honestly I don't reversals but I do feel conflicted about it all so it's not an easy yeah it's a good question because it is something that I still wrestle wet for the first few years I definitely read the reversals and yeah cuz all the books tell you you have to and then you think what if it came out reverse that that is different than a bright like a course there should be some different interpretation so when I decided to stop reading reversals I just don't let my cards come out reverse like I just shuffle them all up right and then the way that I choose a card is just kind of hand over hand and so they don't they're not even allowed to  I do read reversals I ended it for that reason because I do feel that if it's reversed it there's a reason and so I do I can see where the confliction comes in but it's interesting when I read professionally I would always reset my cards between clients and I would take them I would cleanse them and I would put them all up right I would then have the client Shuffle the cards while they thought about their question I can't think of one okay maybe one person in all the years I red cards did not reverse cards everybody somehow and they're shufflers shuffle cards every single time and so in my mind if they reversed it that meant it had meeting but you know if you're reading for yourself I don't necessarily know like when I'm journaling I don't know I do I do I do I do write down that it's reversed okay nevermind I do always reversal  and I don't think there's a right or wrong way I'll know just each card does have a range of meanings that include the sort of reversed mean it in a percent round it yeah that's how I look at it is it depends on what cards are either side to side or above or below you know what is around it and that's kind of where I get the is it an upright or is it a reversal meeting whether it's upright a reverse physically you know you kind of have to see the whole picture and not just the one card card contains all of its meanings in it no matter how its position I think it's what you were saying and if you do read reversals that might be a way to clue you in to how to interpret it it's just I don't know I think for me I just got they just became too like to the gave me anxiety and I just  I just wanted to cut out that element from the reading so I tried it and then I just ended up kind of sticking with it and it feels like it's working for me right now but I may go back and read reversals at some point I just yeah I just wanted to have them or I wanted to have a more streamlined approach I think and so that helped her through my night but I do flip flop back and forth about that do you shuffle them in a way that reversals could come out yes a lot of AI Shuffle and if I did it Layla's way I can see we're okay if you get a reverse so that means something but with the way I shuffle 50% of the deck is bound to be Rivers. Yeah yeah yeah yeah  Shuffle in a chaotic way  Brown on the floor and all around the better I communicate with a doctor better relationship that we have the more they'll speak to me no matter what position there is no matter how they come out of the deck they have a story to tell and if I'm in tune with it it doesn't matter how it comes out of the doctor tell you what it's going to tell you so the better I know exact the more like that I tend to read absolute but definitely this book like we said we're not joking this is a great little handbook to have tossed it in your backpack keep it with your tarot Journal this is really going to give you some insight if you know about the full star any or this is your first time you've heard about the Fool's Journey this is going to give you some amazing information it's great for self-reflection it's great for Magical working it's a wonderful tool to know the full story and  book will give you a lot of inside so five rooms up absolutely I really appreciate it thank you thank you thank you Natalie for joining us thanks for having me thank you so much dear Natalie labriola author of terrible time with secrets of the Ancient Mariner for joining shell and I are back on the broomstick we had an amazing time talking about one of shells and my favorite topics are out and of course thank you to all of our listeners for joining us on this conversation as well please like subscribe give us some reviews if you start it really helps the show up and help the other listings to find it we will see you in next week for another episode of back on the broomstick until then be wise to be Wicked and as always you magical people keep it with g

----------------------------------------
welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire be friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a back on the broomstick I'm Layla and for this episode we've opened up the solarium to talk about our favorite herbs for a summer of spellcrafting these just aren't your basic T herbs we're going to tell you how to incorporate these into your practice for smokable sippable herbalicious spells so grab your mortar and pestle your favorite smoking apparatus and a teacup and join us on this magical herbal episode I'm show in Layla's making it awfully fancy because I'm going to route of we know that I have a Penance for killing things so we're going to talk about some herbs that I like that I can actually grow and keep alive so hey let's do this super excited to talk about Arabs and summer is here in the northeast of the USA and it feels to me like this is going to be in the summer of some serious spell-casting so we decided to grab what we think will be the five most used herbs or spell crafting and  summer of 2025 shell decided to go with herbs that she can grow which you know if she can grow them you know they're pretty resilient and I decided to focus on herbs that were useful not just an incense but also Inseparable and smokable sounds well you know what I kind of look at my five herbs as a try it too I have a history of growing / keeping things alive and not growing not keeping things alive exactly I'm going to talk about some things tonight that I actually me of all people can grow from seed all the way to plucking it for Magical purposes and for me that's like amazing things that you can grow things that you can Harvest yourself definitely have a strong connection and can be a very strong Ally in spellcraft however you can also buy herbs off the grocery store shelves are you can buy Gerbes that someone else crew it or someone else drive and they will work for you beautifully in your spellcraft as well  stop I have picked fire herbs and it was difficult I had a hard time narrowing it down because there's so many that I like especially when you start talkin about smokable spell but I picked five that I think are very summary and would be very useful in what I think are like witchy summer type spells enough for me for the past couple of years have been growing 5 / 6 so I'm going to talk about the five or six that I actually have physically grown myself kept alive when I originally started the use cuz some of them I've been growing year after year now I picked seeds that I knew that I would end up using for Magical purposes if that makes sense but I went with the idea of let me grow this so that I can then use it for Magical purposes ritualistic purposes that type of thing  I like having a magical garden and a kitchen Garden if I am able to not always able to so sometimes I'll just have herbs that do like Rosemary or culinary Sage or things like that things that I can use in cooking and in Magic a girl a couple of I use either dried for incense or have put in teas so multi-purpose saw the first on my list but I'm going to talk about is one of my favorites and it's actually invasive so I'm not even allowed to order cease if I want to try and grow it here and I know so many people who can find it growing in the ditch or growing in their backfield or something and I have not yet been lucky enough to find a reliable stash of it but the first on my list is mugwort it is actually in in Northeast in New York state in Pennsylvania I'm not sure where else but I know those two states is considered  invasive and you can't even order seeds for it it makes me sneeze I'm not going to lie it's absolutely my favorite because it's fabulous okay it's not exactly wonderful until you but the effects of it in TR great and it's also really good in in senses and magical working it's a nerve is associated with the possibly because they kind of silvery like the underside of the leaves and have like that silver and green look to it so that might be part of it but it says it's a very deeply feminine herb I think and it has a lot to do with dreaming and with DreamWork the liminal spaces it can help you with your psychic abilities it can enhance Clairvoyance clairaudience working with ancestors and with spirit is also excellent for banishing negative energies and for psychic protection it's just a really great which is Herb no Layla and I are by no means giving any sort of medical advice on any luck  so please don't ever take it as that but I have a problem with mugwort this is why I don't use it very often in any sort of spell work and in something people like might want to take know what I was I am actually allergic to mugwort and when I smell it breathed Amira touch it anything in my vicinity I can't breathe and I start sneezing my brains out and like there has been times when I've used it going into it knowing that I'm going to have a sneeze the van but overall I do try to avoid it just for the fact that it is something that if you're allergic to like everything outside mugwort might not be a good thing for you to be to be utilizing but again by no means after 2 Sunday my personal experience in our standard disclaimer here she'll and I are fabulous witches we are not very good doctors  that you're going to smoke make into a tea and just in any way you need to figure that out with your doctor research do all the things we're only here to tell you the key aspects I I see its purposes and it is it is very good I just personally am not a fan because it triggers me not being able to breathe out of my nose as long as you're not allergic to this is one of those things that I really love to make into smoke bundles I like to try and make a smoke bundle this makes fabulous cleansing bundles if you're going to be doing a ritual or spell were this opens up that liminal space this is going to connect you with your psychic abilities is going to enhance your intuition your Clairvoyance your inner sight so you can use this in a smoke bundle you can grind it up and add it to a smokable spell you can put it in your tea and a smokable it's a very full body smoke so it's  use that is the main ingredient although a little bit goes a long way and it has a very pleasant taste however in t sometimes it has a little bit more of a musty he has not the greatest and tea again a little bit goes a long way but if you use it especially before you go to sleep before you do any type of meditation or DreamWork mugwort is fabulous prophetic dreams for Clairvoyance actually used it in the past the few times I have used it I have blended it into a loose incense mixture and it's great for like virtual incense because it kind of takes what you've got and makes that super Smokey I don't know I think it's just super Smokey but like I said I tend to stay away from it but I have used to this like a base for loosen sense some people consider it to be a feminine herb and associated with the goddess Artemis in particular other people associated with the  an aspect of the Goddess it's more the dark side of the Goddess is when you want to go within and it can also be an ally for you if you're trying to maybe confront your dark side if you're doing Shadow work if you have things that are difficult that you need to see through mugwort can help you with that as well so if you don't want to ingest it you can use it in an incense you can use it in a smok stick you can put it in a dream pillow but it's a fantastic herb for that and I think summers are very good time for dreaming and dreaming of the future so that's why I put it in there so we're going to talk about my first herb here that is a tad invasive basically once you grow it is like I don't even know what like like a weed that I think I know what you're going to say so might my first one is going to be meant my first mint plant and  end of the season I didn't know I am like the last person who should really be planting anything in like the mulch Pile in between my house and the tile across the way let me just say that five years on shit tournament over there but did I learned my lesson so I had a friend who do you know that was pretty shity so I took these cuttings who would give me cuttings to like I know what I'm doing first of all but somehow this is why mince words out for me let's talk about resiliency here folks I just take these to whatever cutting shove them in some dirt cuz you know I don't know any better that shit has grown for the last 3 years  this year I saw a gun that it was dead and I was going to dump it out and I put another pot in that pot cuz I was going to dump them both out literally met his grown around it and it just like you ain't killing me woman no matter how hard you try I think meant works for me because of the resiliency so if you do not have a green thumb men is one of the things you need to do keep it in a pot don't grow it in the ground or it will take over seriously like I have more across the street then I need to but there's a lot of different uses for it I've been kind of trying to get away from Sage I will talk about in a minute as far as like a cleansing so men can be used for cleansing or protection the same as you know Sage could be  last summer when I had I was making men and Sage bundles which and I just smelled amazing we won't talk about the peppermint or spearmint we're just going to leave it at MIT and move on Prosperity I love men for Prosperity than cleansing for what else is there also amplifying your intentions you know everything is about intentions we want to always put intentions into all of our spells and rituals in this kind of will amplify that for you I'm not as big on the smoke a bowl since you are so generally I am doing like I said in the last summer I kind of got into making bundles loosen sentence in the t's and on a nice hot day minty can't beat it relate a lot  communication that relates that cooling sensation in your mouth or in your throat it could also sue the other things soothe tempers soothe play even such thing as with inside you like anxiety but it also has that fiery activation it's also very active like you said it will grow anywhere it'll take over so its abundance as well it has that strong energy of abundance of both in mint hurts so good with men yes apartments on my list as well for a lot of the same reason resiliency was like I was like man this is definitely for me cuz I can't kill it exactly exactly because meant when you eat it or you take it as a tea or even if you smoke it is very nice and a smokable also very cooling have a nice  waiver no matter how you take it if you smoke it if you eat it if you take it as a tea mint can be very good for your stomach so that can also help you ground that can be a wonderful way to Center and ground yourself is a little bit of minty and again with that fire and cooling aspect of it it's good for balance and balance in yourself and just like you were sitting with the mug or you can also put it in like a sachet under your pillow or drink it is to promote dreams or visions because I don't think it's you know how sometimes you like kind of a way we can kind of asleep Alpha State like a sleep as well as there are people that use this is part of love spells I never have but you know what you gotta do what you gotta do  well I guess I think it goes back to the balance it's the fiery B and the cooling qualities both in one plant so I think that can help you in a relationship to have balance and good things in a relationship I've never used it for that but again you do you mostly for joy happiness abundance success those types of things and I don't know why I like I like it and I think this is so ridiculous of me but you know how so I think of me sometimes as a cleanser know I love that it's perfect Association like I said I sometimes try to get away from the stage thing is is a cleanser is Oracle answer or or Spirit has definitely been something that I've tested and I feel like sometimes when people use Sage to cleanse  like bring a shit down but it almost like spring this like this or like bringing the level of excitement instead of a level of calm does that make sense now before we move our lovely peppermint I do have a story for you okay so there is a Greek myth about it and how it came to me and it has to do with our lovely goddess Persephone Persephone and Hades have been married for a while in this myth and hate much like the other men in his family is a horndog can't keep it in his pants and is running around and finds this by all accounts absolutely stunning gorgeous woman named meant he snatches her up they have a fling and somehow Persephone finds out that she turned her into a plant to get rid of her yes Persephone  not like her mother is an agricultural goddess and so she turned that's cheating woman into a place she should have turned into a plant I mean kind of like the soap operas of the 80s so this water nymph was turned into a plant by Persephone and Hades who felt awful if his part in this whole thing gave her the lovely fragrance and taste of mint and he must have made her resilient because I can't kill meant for nothing not even for Stephanie wanted to kill her just so I am going to use you and go right into my second one in in in cut you off like that was like the first thing I tried to  I plan to this plant I happen to have two pots now but this first pot I legit planted five years ago I am not joking you I will take a picture for you it is still outside and regrowing I this is another one I can't kill this I am I have amazed myself I left it out in the winter I didn't clean the leaves out of it mosque I have battered and bruised the sage probably more than any other plant and it just says bitch you ain't killing me again I like using 4 bundles I like using it for cleansing I don't drink so much because it's to me has a weird taste so many good uses for sage and it just really started out as a can I grow this I'm telling you resilient plant number to can't kill it for the life of me, nari sage and white sage that a lot of our  this might be familiar with our to do we personally prefer to do in a civil or a smoke a bowl this is more used in a bundle or loosen sense it just is very grounding it's very earthy culinary Sage is more for I would say in my personal opinion is more grounding is more for when you need to tell me energy down when you need to be settled and strong and standing strong so I guess in some ways it can be a cleansing Urban that way because you're bringing things back to basics whereas white sage but a lot of people are familiar with that's going to be more of us actually clearing out the negative energy it's also uplifting and it has a lot of spiritual significance for some need of people so it doesn't two different ways I would say different episode totally different between culinary sage and why you saying  good one to grow into have for that grounding and that Earth thing that's why I sometimes think and also it depends on what kind of digging for deeper was so I don't know why this particular breed of States makes me think down that path I think you sometimes it depends what I mix it with but I think that everybody if you're going to grow a little herb garden get the stage from the Home Depot it should be a staple in your in your garden and I I really like to add it to bundles because it does add that good strong solid base element base 4 bundles and it's a good base for loose incense  fantastic all right so my third I picked one that is very summery and very fun it's a tropical herb so maybe that's why you no kind of gives me that summer Vibe also it's magical and physical properties the kind of give you that summer feeling Adventure positive energy it's about Summer Romance and loving yourself you know what's that bright sunny happy it was all those wonderful luscious sensual feelings of Summertime with my dude at all the sudden get Practical Magic virus that's the Belladonna is in the bag and yes we have Belladonna not on this episode. Be careful with that everything all of these even the peppermint please be careful with all the people but yes. Research talk to your herbal list talk to your doctor talk to your pagan  Minister I don't know before you do any of these you could always use it and don't inhale but if you're me I was in hell because I really do have never smoked this what what is what's the taste like a smokeables taste kind of like a floral grassy sweet to me it smokes and tastes like a like an RV cannabis it's nice this plant is sun-loving it's beautiful yellow flowers you smoke the leaves and the flowers by the way now you just smoke this itself or in a mixture I smoked it almost always in a mixture but it can be smoked on its own it's very cannabis like as a smoked so it can act as a base and a mixture and Damiano all right so is Passion This is Love romantic love since you  quality burn in an incense have it in tea have it in your smokable definitely all about fire and son he bowled in ancient times it was used as an aphrodisiac oh yes we know that the Aztecs and the Mayans drink Damiana tea as an aphrodisiac and for love spells but I mostly smoke it more for its relaxation and and kind of mellow feel good qualities taste better if you steep it too long so again little goes a long way just in time so you can also take it as a tincture you can take it as a capsule if it's too high of a dose use caution because it can be a little bit of a hallucinogenic but when you smoke it it helps you to be relaxed a little euphoric you can kind of feel a little sensual a little happy I was going to say  the little blue pill if you do you know this is going to be for love potions self-love if you want to do glamour spells if you want to do a little romance ritual Damiano is going to be your go-to make that a big part of your incense or part of your smokable again you're going to want to blend it with other things in your smoke a bowl or in your teeth but you're going to be you know happy with that awakened that energy awakened that sensuality permission  and don't take that Liana unless you know what you doing but yeah go ahead use it as an incense it's it's just fabulous Earth for love so it really reminds me of Summer you know I think about summer romances and doing things with my love in the summertime so Damiana should be a staple for any type of Love magic in the summer with flowers with me. Matt has a summer thing now because it can also be like a euphoric and a hallucinogenic just can also help you get in touch with your psychic senses it's a little bit of a lemon herb so yes it's love and lust and sensuality but if you're doing it in a meditative space it can also be meditations very deep meditations on self-love deep meditation to heal yourself or to find that love within yourself if you don't have it so you can use it in a lot of dream walking very psychic  or you could just use it as part of an incense or an oil blends a candle dressing you don't have to ingest any of these in order to use them in your spot work okay what are you got next on your list this is another one this is again on the list of all I'm so glad you put that in there no this all started with me having cats and like I have so much like I don't even know like again I can't kill this for the life of me I've left it out in the snow and the cold and it grows back every year I don't know if but it's definitely not easily killed but again this is something that can be used for protection it can be used to enhance intentions love Magic Friendship  warding off negativity and you know obviously because my cat's left associated with me and my children loved for many many years and he was a lover and a hater but we love them and there's been times where when I burned it in an incense a feel like my my old Kitty Boys Around  that's so sweet maybe you remember the Lick Lick bite so I don't get in touch with that feline energy but that could just be me being crazy and trying to connect with my cat that has passed away and using this is means I don't know I don't see why it wouldn't work I mean you know if you can call and say things that they like why not a beloved Cat spirit but I will tell you this cuz I did test this Theory so you know how the catnip makes me kitty cats loopy right and I've given it to him fresh I've dried it out and saved you know piecemeal that to him over the winter so I thought you sent it to me because it makes the cats and stuff Damm it even though it's kind of a hallucinogenic to cats  did I utilize some loose and sent you can smoke catnip have smoke catnip smoking it also will not give you the cat woohoo it's a relaxing it's actually very calming and very relaxing this is one of those herbs that I would recommend that you mix with a base herb of some type Mullen usually cannabis if that's your bag but a little bit of catnip with other herbs is very nice. I like is the lone soldier is that there's different herbs will have a different tastes like a different mouthfeel the smoke from different herbs will be different so you want like a full body smoke to be the main part of your of your smoke and then you'll add your flavoring herbs and your support of hers after that so catnip would be more like a flavoring  I feel like we've kind of inadvertently got like all these protection of purifying things going on but this is definitely something that you could mix into a loose incense for protection magic for cleansing magic repelling negativity I've never used it with any sort of Love relations associate the association with love with catnip is because he obviously loved it if you want someone to go crazy for you like a cat goes the catnip or sometimes people will describe something that's super desirable as catnip do say oh that's like catnip to me chocolate is like catnip to me honestly I'm not sure if I would roll around on the ground and in bunny pop my belly with my feet over chocolate but there's like  looks like catnip  but yeah some people saved use that saying right so if there's someone that's like catnip to you that you want them or you want them to think of you that way I guess I could see using the herb that way but like I had had all these cut some of the leaves the other dryer get fresh to the cats right there I dropped like a handful of Leaves last summer here where I dropped that little pile there is actually catnip growing out between the Rocks this is again like super resilient so it's on my my top list of things to try fashion I got a couple catnip plants last year that I put in one of my garden and I don't know yet if they're coming up again this year cuz there's like twenty seven different things all growing in that part of the garden cuz it's a little neglected so maybe if you remember from last year when you just recently moved into the house you're in currently  remember when I walked up your stairs I walked up and under your first are no and I'm hoping it comes back this year I'm not sure if those are up yet either well if my cat nip gives any indication nothing will kill that shit and it'll be back what is your next one my next one is a little more fun like you said we had a lot of protection cleansing this one is joy and abundance light and attraction and it's all about happiness and confidence this is calendula also called Marigold I remember is a kid when it was like towards the end we would have to pick the heads off and my mother would make us pluck out the little flower petal things off to collect the seeds to drive for the next year  Ziploc bags full of little last year my dad brought me over it's really nice plants are full of a whole bunch of plants and marigolds and he made sure to tell me that as they died and is dried off Iris to pluck a pause and save them I did so I know those will be coming back that was a big part of my childhood from I refuse to acknowledge her witchy ways grandmother so Marigold calendula you can use that you can use them for protection you can use them to prevent evil from coming in you can also scatter the leaves in the ER the pedals under your bed for prophetic dreams they are associated with remembrance ceremonies with funerals with the deceased depending on your culture there are some cultures that use them for that part of that  is because of the sunnybright nature of these flowers they're so beautiful that they help you to remember the sweetness of Life the brightness of life so even when you're remembering someone who has passed they help you to remember the joy of that person's life you know it's so funny that you say that because when I was younger people still do this but not as much as back in the day you know we get dragged to the cemetery in the spring time to clean off every person I've ever been blood related to Evers grave Stone and my grandmother would literally everybody is Tombstone and I'm like why would you pick these flowers of all things now it's all making sense to me it's about remembrance but it's more about remembering the happy times it's about positivity enjoy so it's not remember your ancestors are the Dead with sadness that's why they're so bright and remind you of the sun because you're supposed to remember them and happiness and enjoy in better times  well they also growing Sunshine colors orange and yellow and so now in ritual there used a lot to connect with ancestors but they're also used for healing ritual more for like emotional healing for soothing a broken heart if you have Painful memories that you can't get over if you have regrets if you have problems in your life that you really want to soothe and move past colangelo's really good for that because I got it helps you to see the positive side of things that helps you to see that the sun will come up even after things have been difficult because honestly I'm not going to lie I never thought of marigolds for a magic purpose obviously obviously but like going in planting  would plant a garden she would always plant Marigold all around the perimeter of the garden and it's because there are natural pest repellent insect repellent because of that again this idea of sympathetic magic like-for-like magic because it for his past you can also use it to tutor negative energy I need past like energy you don't want to come into your house if you put up marigolds around the perimeter of your house that will help keep negativity from being able to come in my grandma wants to know which just ask her for your grandmother planting them as a remembrance for the dead it was to remember them with joy I'm not going to lie I just thought cuz they were cheap flowers at the grocery store I'm like you said they're yellow and orange so if you want to bring joy you want to sprinkle some sunshine in your life grab some of those pedals and use it in a spell in a smokable spell same thing it's uplifting it has a  very nice citrusy kind of taste taste like sunshine but again put it in with a with a base herb as a flavoring and with the intention to uplift bring joy into your life and vigor Grecian bring happiness you can use it for money the Golden Globe money so again that uplifting happy joy success all of those things you put that in your smokable spell do I find it funny that you diverted to kind of something a little flowery so my next one also happens to be floury to me this is like a staple chamomile need I say more  so sweet so so how I first fell in love with chamomile which is super funny is I absolutely love daisies I don't know why I got no Rhyme or Reason I think they remind me of my childhood my grandma used to freaking crocheted I don't know if we look the same and as I got older and kind of got into to herbalism little bit I learned or not be making like homemade tea trying to to make signatures and conjure my own little tea recipes I like how it grows cuz it's so pretty but I'm kind of promoting that positiveness like some of the other things we've talked about it can kind of repeal that negativeness and kind of that little protection balance  as with everything we've talked about you can use it for love but this is one of those thing is that there's something about a flower popping that brings you Joy you know I like growing sage in the man in the in the catnip but there's something about watching that flower pop maybe I'm a weirdo I don't know in New York and there was a couple of times that I would pick off the heads and Float the flower heads in my bath and take like a chamomile bath you want a relaxing bath and that's once I don't generally burn it a lot just because with chamomile chamomile in Mighty in just about any tea I can throw some chamomile I tend to get mine and big bags and it's it's dried and it's usually the head of the flower and I like to it's good for  dreaming that that sleeping that that deep inner Alpha / sleep work where I want to have a soothing slow gentle energy my only problem with smoking chamomile if you definitely need a grinder it's a pain those big flowers you got to grind them up like I said my go-to with chamomile his stuff that summer in a cup right there but also if you have problems sleeping or if you have anxiety about sleeping this can kind of get you into that relax and mellow sleepy mode actually what there is a 80 brand I can't remember which one it is but it's one of the top three brands they do one cup of Sleepytime  what is chamomile tea people and if you're going to be doing meditation if you're going to be doing dream work and you don't want to do something like Mug war or Damiana that's a little little more psychoactive a little stronger chamomile is a wonderful wonderful herb to use to assist you if you're going to be doing meditation work or dream work if you're like me and not allergic to the mugwort maybe you want to drink a cup of chamomile tea with like you said that's funny because that's going to bring in that Sunshine that summer energy before you do a tarot reading or before you do your Terrell drawers I've also mixed it with the meant that I grow to give you the energy that Clarity from the sunshine and that'll also give you the calmness and the connection to your psychic ability from the chamomile and so that just kind of helps you use into that meditation or into that psychic work that you're doing this one  it's definitely one of the top ones I like it because the smell is good to taste as good and again I can mix it with different things it mixes well with other things it plays well with others in the sandbox well I can mix this with I go and buy kind of loose teas ingredients for loose teas I can mix rose hips that I buy with the chamomile and kind of make my own little Laura Lee blend of tea I like to use it not just solely by itself but mixed with other things that mixes well with other flavors if you're doing the tea thing and didn't spell work adding chamomile to your spell in in whatever form incense to use multiple rings that subtle happiness that quiet Joy  brings a nice even Keel a nice even centeredness to whatever you're doing it's it's gentle it's nice it's calming and you can pretty much add that to any spell that you're doing to just bring a nice note into it to just bring that nice calming energy was something like chamomile exactly and not in a jarring way into some nice smooth way but it's also one of those things where it's nice to just kind of sit out on the deck on a summer evening and just drink some chamomile tea for the sake of it doesn't even have to be for Magical reasons it's good to just just drink and join me on Minton Road  now my last herb this one's my favorite and it's another one that I used to have growing in abundance in my yard and I wish I did now and you're probably going to laugh at me when I say it is stinging nettle what I love it it's perfect you are a weirdo I'll give you that magically health-wise stinging nettles are fantastic this herb has been used for thousands of years all over the place is stinging nettle for a reason I used to play with it when I was a kid in each other on purpose so I know all about did you know that if you pick stinging nettle from the bottom up you won't get stung if you touch a more from the top down you're going to get stung and it's going to react you worse really  L is for strength is for protection is all about by tality it's also good for boundaries if you're doing Shadow work or if you need to enforce your own boundaries or work with boundaries it's fabulous for that I've actually I do stinging nettle and put it on my window so this is like a like a like a ward of sorts now you can't eat it you can smoke it you can drink it cooking it will inactivate the chemical that's in this thing I've ever drank it what's that taste like green it's green it's not bad it's good but it's very good for you actually but it's also good for empowerment and resilience and smoke a blunt you can smoke it once you dry it in small I would only put it in small amounts doesn't really taste like much smoked don't really do much but it is good for grounding in a smokable spell it has been used in all sorts of rituals there are  rituals in ancient Greece it's one of the herbs that are in the Anglo-Saxon nine herbs charm for protection the Celts use stinging nettles and they felt that it would protect them from fairies and from elves people have used it to cleanse themselves people would actually take bundles of fresh Nettles and they'll beat themselves with it yeah and I have never done it but from what I've heard it's very invigorating it is kind of good for you and no kids it was not heard that before it's only going to hurt for a minute  when done by a practitioner it can help clear away negativity in your body and can help break hexes it can help you with Clarity renewal the Celts used to feed their cattle Metals so that they couldn't be hexed by witches weird have you ever heard of the seven swans think so it's one of my favorite mix and it has to do with Metals other than on The Twelve Days of Christmas seven swans a-swimming a king who had seven sons and a daughter and he married a new Queen and somehow a curse came weather from the queen or someone who came to the land I'm not sure depends on the tail and those seven sons were turned into Swan the daughter was banished and she found the queen of the fairies who told her that's a break the curse on her brother's she had to meet them each a shirt from Nettles now the stock of metals is very fibrous you can actually make fabric and rope things like  from the stalk of metals and so part of this was she couldn't speak the entire time I do feel like I didn't work out did not work out so she's Gathering all these stinging nettles at night and in graveyards trying to hide from the queen and she can't speak and the king from a neighboring country sees her out one night and she's Gathering these metals to knit shirts for her brothers and of course he falls in love with her I don't know why but anyway she can't talk to him so he brings her back to his castle but she continues to gather nettles in the graveyards at night she only has until the end of the year to finish the shirts and break the curse on her brother's so she keeps doing this in secret now trying to hide from the King until one night and adviser to the king sees her besides this is evil Witchcraft and tell the king that she's a witch and has to be burned and because she can't speak she can't defend herself so the date of her death is coming very soon and it's also wrong  the same time to her time limit for making these shirts for her brother's is coming so she's dating and knitting and knitting as she's being dragged to the steak and her brothers come in the form of swans and she throws the shirts over them just in the nick of time and she wasn't able to finish the last one there was one sleeve missing on the last one so one brother always had the wing of a swan but they were all able to come back she lives and was able to speak and declare her Innocent but she was knitting needles so it metals can help you break curses they can help protect you from Barry they can help to do boundaries and so that's kind of encapsulated a little bit in that story I don't know how  my best and final herb this is I know something that is kind of a Mainstay with you it just didn't make your top five list but we're going to talk a little bit about the historically wonderful Rosemary Rosemary for everything protection getting rid of negative energy like everything I feel like it everything that all the years we've talked about tonight or all about you can burn that you can smoke at you can drink it like what can't you use rosemary for this one is more of a I do better with the grocery store Rosemary I'm not going to lie don't judge me but I am trying this year to grow it we'll see how that works out I'll update you later but again this one can be like one thing that a tea can be used for  action during Dream Magic so again another good one too kind of combined with chamomile chamomile can get you there Rosemary I'll protect you from all the ugly book Ali's while you're there so it's Universal for cleansing warding off negative energy some people even use it again like you were saying with the marigold this can be one that folks used to kind of Honor ancestors honor the dead there's just so many uses for Rosemary it's like a it's like allspice it's like the allspice of things you can grow can you use allspice for everything you do I have don't judge it's a tool to have in every tool box because you can pull out Rosemary and use it in a pinch for anything you said it's like the clear quartz of our nervous because it is if you need to substitute for something and you don't know what to use use rosemary it's  one of those it's like the universal substitute like their cards it really is the Swiss army knife of herbs for sure cuz you can pretty much everything I mean I I can't think of anything I wouldn't use it for just because it is kind of universal and that could just be me making up my own definitions for Rosemary but again this is my first go at getting it from Wegmans so we'll see how that goes Rosemary is a typical smoke of mine I'll have to go back through my notes I can't think of the last time or when I ever tried it usually I use an incense has in a smoke bundle or an illusion sense if so good not as a main ingredient but it's a good like active ingredient in tea I wouldn't drink just Rosemary playing too cuz it's kind of not the greatest but it is something that you can use this kind of a little accent Woody with the phone  an acceptable or a smokable spell you don't have to just put it in the one I say we want to do some Dream Work and so we've decided we're going to make a chamomile tea with a little bit of and rosemary in it you don't need to put in a half a cup of Rosemary you can make a mainly chamomile tea as your main ingredients and if you'd like to just a little bit in spell work even a small amount even just a small amount of the herb carries the entire magical intent it doesn't have to be equal parts talk to that herb tell it your intention to hey Rosemary Swiss army knife clear quartz of herbs I would like you to focus on supporting me through my dream work and then to sprinkle tiny bit in your teeth their intentions can be done in just a small amount I guess is what I'm saying you don't need to have a ton of it a little goes a long way from a small point  so I think that maybe my take away with my five that I picked are those things that you think you can actually grow and if you're not going to grow this thing as you know maybe their things are going to buy at the store Put a Little Love in to him that seems to be working for me you know a little love goes a long way with plants I'm learning so between the two of us we definitely have a pretty good Apothecary for summer spell work I think I care and I I have one that you can use and abuse and they'll still grow, because I'm so damn proud of myself proud of you too that is exciting I know your outdoor plants tend to do better than your indoor plants but it's pretty impressive that you can grow anything  sorry. You know our five hours of summer is actually more like 10 or 11 herbs of Summer but hey you can never have too many and this definitely you know we both had a struggle keeping it down to this much there's there's so many more we could have covered so I wanted to talk about dandelions but next time next time that you can use for your summer of spells this year if you are looking for something to grow maybe we've inspired you maybe we've given you something that like me you can't kill no matter how hard you try maybe just something that you can buy at your local witch tea shop down the store the point is we want you to get into a groove of growing some herbs learning and some herbs keeping some herbs in your toolbox and loving them loving them like we love them whether it's smokeable or in an incense herbs add so much to your cell work I hope you  guys are having a wonderful summer and are going to add some of these herbs to your working so thanks so much we will see you next week in the meantime give us some like some stars and reviews that really helps the show out and makes our summer a little better I got to go I got plans to water yes you do you need to keep them alive and proof of Life shall we need proof of life life all right so I'm going to go wrap up some herbs in a nice little smokable joint and we will see you next week be wise be Wicked

A overlay and that was really a connection again back to the other side of my brain to the statistics and and backlog knowledge and history of what I done did in the book I have a question how do you mix Druid work both Magic from your Homeland and living in the outskirts of Boston  yeah after reading the book I'm thinking you know if I were practicing Alpine folk magic and you know I have a similar perspective I'm I'm on the North Shore of Boston and tell him I mingling with this environment and complex to practice all these things in such a different environment that almost send the trees and in the end Open Fields and then with the Alpine tall snow peak mountains in in our concrete Village in a Grove  call it to the group of people who meets know at least eight times a year to do the fast and often enough for that standard directions to bring our bardic inspiration into that part of the ritual or the winter solstice in the pearl in Massachusetts already know that that's lots of land and Roads around so far and 4850 people and everybody knew that place and when they when we went to the Ridgewood Place until the sun comes up as I stepped back and and and nobody noticed really that I wasn't there  how many people do things but don't know why and dressed up as Grandpa's in in the back of my fake you know how about on my back and so forth and then go in the ritual I was called in that was part of how I wrote it but then I ran into that circle like they do in in Austria right and yelled at them in in Austrian. He knows people and ran at them and whack them a little bit but no articles with this which cuz that's part of it but it became part of the in in the dark in the woods of Berlin Mass that's how I can am able to sometimes bring into that  the Middlesex Fells Reservation I don't know if you know that that's a huge Winchester Medford in middle of that a large piece of land that state park or something and I do a lot of dog walking there and do I collect Pine resin from there for my much we can make a lot of things myself like that the candle that is building background made herself with the mother worked as hanging the background when it's full of pictures and sounds in there and then I collect things for that as much as you can in the forest where big collectors of growing things and I have my own little dried herbs that can go in a lucky enough to have a collection of mugwort drying yet but hopefully this year you're kind of bring it back to the book this really intrigued me because you do edits as we talk  when we see each other in person as our listeners know I'm up in Salem and if nothing else it is discussed before and as you know the accused here were actually not witches and I was really surprised when when we had our conversation at the Sacred Space conference that the accused witches in Austria actually War which is at least some of them at least you actually have documented verified information which I find absolutely fascinating and I was talking to Layla prior to ask it's almost like if you had a textbook conversation this has a lot of factual information but it comes across as a comp  seishin I'm going to go you one better it's not even a conversation okay I am a huge fan of folklore and Mysteries in the Supernatural your book did not read like a textbook at all it felt more to me but the people are in the True Crime nowadays write the podcast about true crime and you want to hear about all the court cases you have factual information about these court cases and some of them read like the most salacious interesting wild court cases that you might hear on a True Crime podcasts in textbook way in a bad way but documented like I have this one that I want to talk about a minute you have you know the accused their interrogation date the court they were this is Hardcore fax this isn't Siri and conjecture I am surprised that the stuff was actually put in the court documents like that blew me away for a second  Christian if you would please explain a little bit about the history of their witch trials they were kind of freaking out about right now so you can just a little bit brief as possible cuz I could talk about an hour and a half at the time when was written so that's sort of when the witch trials started and what happened to her was that both the beach. Started a little bit early up and burned record of people just didn't think that was an important came and we can see from from the beach towels how overtime the ideas of the imported into the  thinking of the judges and prosecutors before the book and then or in popular culture I guess you could say I kind of switch a little bit I think what happened was that the judges the judges were kind of the elite one of the group of a little better at least somewhat educated agreed and and and and so forth has Auffenberg actually Mobility themselves and they kind of felt probably compelled to implement what's in there in order to not get in trouble themselves make sense that happened in a lot of places and therefore his absurd as some of those accusations were they thought well you know that they match the pattern the match what's in that book and I better use that as our or accepted us as legit evidence  in order to not get prosecuted myself and if they didn't listen to those things then they might be accused know if I'm not listening maybe that people will think that I'm also doing evil thing as a scary time in the early 1500s were most often something actually happened somebody got poisoned or stomach also started giving blood email or something and the money is money to go back to you. The devil is all behind that that's where it became so I became a little bit weird it in terms of accusation flying out of the chimney on an open pipe with the devil and Prada  everybody knew that the farmer's wife did not fly off think so and receive also in the witch trials how that affect the influence of an economist work influences the the death penalty in the rise of it and is he a lot of increase of women because they're quite a bit of man jumping over all accused of Witchcraft higher than those of War happen in a lot of people come back cuz I will Returns come back have nothing can't work there often disabled or did they don't know what the birthday cousin ever learn anything and so they stop using things like witchcraft to make a coin every now and then and then and then males being prosecuted  because they are kind of disturbing the peace of the community coming back didn't have jobs and so they resorted to like folk magic so they became like the village which essentially from what I understand and your book they were mostly that accused of being a witch they're mostly accused of doing witchcraft exactly so they would be like the the folk healer the person you go to and you know my neighbor made all my chickens die so I want to I want to make all their milk go bad and so you'd go to this Village person and he would give you a spell or something Have you do something to get back at your neighbor to do that Witchcraft and that's what people were starting to get in trouble for at that time exactly and anything that could be seen or observed they do that is out of the little Christian ordinary why would say could be a red flag and then  if the person also had no motivation to accused of that which was not really then then it was basically the next thing goes to court Thursday as one who was called in to reverse a curse on the cow and she is named as a witch so we know basically that she must have offered and was well known that she does those things so the thing though that I observed and notice is that the more romantic image of the witch you know the the person living in the forest alone yeah with the rafters of herbs hanging from the rafters in The Raven on the door came so defender in the Romantic Period in the mid-1800s the richest that we experienced in the Renaissance and and shortly thereafter they as far from  who won record on the lift and I am in a ravine aside from everybody else in shacks and they have to go from from Farm to farm and beg for the food and offered their services and as long as they didn't harm anyone I think they were saying but if you had a beef with them until they are a lot of our Granny's practice granny magic they were Christians but they practice Earth Magic or he'll magic or Mountain magic but it was also like magic but they were Christians they would have given you the evil eye in Baton your name if you had said they were a witch and people very often  at the same case here right now so that's why it was accepted because they would kind of had that veneer of acceptability by following the major religion at least outwardly what is Deborah. Two men are out in the community you get too many of us together and stuff starts print than the witch trials here in Salem but the one thing I found very interesting is that people offered up the Spells and rituals and you detail these out in your book that that blew me away to be able to read some of that stuff didn't do any magic or spells so he had me but these people they said they did say what they did sometime I know that obviously things are different than they were in the in the 14th century 15th century but I just wanted to point one out that I  I found fascinating this is called a spell to help a possessed person and what the spell is obtained the heart and liver of a pike dry and ground it and then smoke is the person with that then rip a black head apart and place it on the possessed person's head ground cinnamon Clover mace and Nutmeg into powder and give that mixture to The Afflicted person first male who at least it's spiced well I mean I just I can't believe that this was all detailed out in court was that was that common were people kind of detailed out some of these spells and rituals when they were on trial but they called sort of in excess of painful interrogation and then there is state animal  and some of them I'm British or where obtained during the painful okay okay but they have to take that into account it was under duress at the same time you have these old people were compelled to say that I've made story admit to the things like that often and often enough to admit to kind of absurd things under to rest so I can get out of that situation I was just like wow A lot of people are given up a lot of spells and rituals and court and I didn't know if I was shocked and Preston  now that's part of what I love reading about in this book because they are extremely interesting and then my Christian like you just said Christian these were allowed to spend under duress and a lot of these have raising wild ingredients that will get into in just a minute so don't try this at home we don't know if they're true so just be careful don't do it at home I think they also but I found very helpful is it's pretty much all sympathetic magic and if it fits that mold that if there's a good chance that it was actually done that way and then it's from I don't know if they're so I went through many more I went over to over a thousand accused oh wow yeah  is not that great in that same vein one of the spells that you have in here is very much Practical Magic that would have seemed like magic to the people at the time in 1669 when this particular court case happen and you're going to have to help me out with the name of the accused here this is a test Celiac Kylie Kylie add grouper to Celia Celia okay Cecilia Gruber December 13th 1669 one of the spells that she details in her trial was to take a horseshoe nail that you found on the street and put it in the fire once it's red-hot you then drop it into bad milk they didn't have refrigeration obviously in the 1600 so late you explain in the book of  it was fresh from the cow and even when it was fresh from the cow could have had bacteria in it so if you had bad milk that tasted bad and you threw a glowing hot piece of metal into it your Century could be sterilizing some of the bacteria in their cooking it and making it safer to eat so this spell is very practical so that's sympathetic magic goes all the way straight to actual real and effective thing to do an effective scientific thing but it would have seemed like magic to these people  do I found in the street  yeah I mean the metal itself to use those things that happened over when you found that in about 7 something although I'm booked another submit it to Laval and another book about all those beasts and creatures that we are having our celebrations around from November to April 30th and all three of us have a different view of the legs and feet of Krampus  but the 15 minutes to drive from different regions that that's enough but I for example have my my view of composite likes are human and the horse to horse I don't see a human and a goat and the horse that could be a connection. Never stay anywhere a lot of folk magic has to do with horse Nails roads Crossroads that's why I'm not surprised at all and Byron Ballard actually said that your history isn't from where you're from it's from where your grandmother is from so that could explain that difference right there real quick before we get off the topic of spells I want to go back to us  talking about some of these accused may have been under duress when they gave some of these spells and one of my favorites is towards the beginning of the book someone mentioned a spell to make it rain and this is the baker's Simon in 1666 and his lovely spell included you had to dry and then grind together Alpine Valerian and stinging nettle which I love Valerian stinging nettle again to Great ingredients also catkins and marjoram and then here's the kicker the droppings of a squeaker which is a baby wild for good name for it so the poop of a pig try that grind it together with these herbs and then smoke it not like a brisket but like the Tok it was wondering if the beggar Simon was like okay you are rested me I'm going to tell you to go smoke some pig  you know sometimes I wonder if maybe they were pulling our leg a little bit with you spell ingredients at least maybe the bigger Simon was he has his coming a couple of times appears in the book the loss of his name basically meaning that he was a stained himself with drink and twist bread probably he probably make it interesting for the people in the court drunk wise person wanders around the countryside  also in this book you do mention a few people that's the outcomes in these cases these court cases were very different a lot of times and they were here in the states and in some other places around the world in some cases these people said yeah I did that spell and this is why and then they were let go because we know so much about that guy Christopher Catholic funeral and they they found at 16 which the items in his house and he was definite yes I remember that guy definitely a lot of Witchcraft and so he  she basically was accused of Witchcraft in the in the staunchly Catholic environment until her and cooked bruised all bad with his witchcraft he always invoked the Christian daily benefit spell start with the Christian dating and he asked Jesus to do things like he know she sent to Steve Devils or demons it's a demon Conjuring spell but okay for good purpose because basically compel it safe to bring stolen goods back and he has another chapter about  weather magic he tells the court another spell how he fended off weather so bad was coming and he would stand some Barren and I'll probably like a movie and book the weather away behind the mountains where no aux moves and no crows and I felt it all in front of the court in front of a priest and the judge doesn't Witness  it was okay and if it didn't suit them they were convicted in Catholic thinking he could prove he was doing good stuff I think the Catholics not have survived British or Jesus or not I would not have people that have time sounds like the reason a lot of people were accused here in Salem was more for petty reasons it was more for land and money and power and things of that nature where is a lot of these trials they actually did some witchcraft some of these it seems to say I love your sense of humor mr. nineteen-hundreds over here  this book I'm reading it and I'm reading of like oh wow beggar Simon here with this poo smoke and paragraph later you very quietly just feel free to place any of those ingredients that you  so I love this  Brooks Twitter or seen wild forest and they are not the reason why people say they keep their guns in case 2240 wild boars come up on their property there I'm going to try out your Instagram because I have seen on your Instagram you had a cough remedy not too long ago few months ago and then it was a nice dear old little herbal joint I myself love herbal smokeables of all kinds and I was trying to guess what you had put in there I'm guessing there was a little Mullen in their time I do it it's perfect it's a fabulous herb there's so many uses for it okay so it was mostly Mall in in just a little time  all right. So now tell us a little bit about did you get into the herbalism here in America or is that something that you got into an ostrich you know where does that come from I think that already and it was a little bit easier because I grew up with all the plants there and dandelion yes I know you're too but there are some things that we don't have a sense that I had for you that kind of leaves into did you when you were growing up in Austria were there other people around in about that practiced witchcraft is this something that kind of died away after the. You're talking in your book I mean are there obviously you know there's probably Modern Day pagan the local  going strong I guess is my question is the Celtic tradition that you mentioned earlier still alive is that thread still in there I would say no to that in the play date is our beginning of the 9th is when when it was much more into indigenous people all around the book mostly practicing and remember it was an old lady we called her contacts between which she gave my dad a salve for his room at Rite Aid and they put that on there and make a day later he had a lot of pimples went there and they went back there what's going on it's all coming out of energy the negativity coming out okay if you get better did it help  suggestion is my book on and I'm talking with them that this is a lot of folks like us now who practice witchcraft in various ways in there as well as some to have a great grandparents who may have written something down or they had a chance to talk to them before they died but came back I meant that exists but it's not it's not the same it's so it's going to be able to look back at some history like this and I also loved at the beginning of your book you talk about looking out at the mountains you talking about being there and and and looking out at the place where  magic is and you know as a druid as a shaman animism and spirits of place and spirits of the land are very very important is there a way that you would like to connect to spirits of place you know where you're at now and the Boston area you like to go hiking and then things like that you mentioned that is there any particular thing you like to or way you like to connect with your local area Middlesex Fells Reservation bear walk the dog there's a place where they can usually make arrests leaning against the tree on and I'll build a relationship with the tree in zone in the place and there's also a wild Juniper Bush on there so I do get my honey bear is for all kinds of things in sense of making bacon volume way to do that is used more than the usual parents do that and then Juniper to you know it's kind  isn't it like a snot astringent 1920s or so they would go through hospital rooms smoke in the mouth with a stripper again that sympathetic magic that is actually does cleanse the area this really does something in the physical world so Juniper smoke would be a wonderful way in the match of maybe we should get back to do things exactly I like that idea too I do want to mention that in your book I was a little intimidated at first because I thought it was going to be like she'll said in the beginning a textbook  within the first few sentences you can really bad and now I'm totally didn't mean I know what you mean but oh my goodness with his folks so much fun to read because it's just kept me Hawks going through the whole thing like shells that is packed with information how to pay just later you have a funny and I really like how at the end of the trial you talked about a lot of them like today you know how would translate today and what they may have tried to use those ingredients for what you know what they may have meant by different things that they did and that was a lot of fun to read this while I really like those connections yeah I was happy to read that I don't really have black hair  mean like cutting off the brass and the legs in the thighs and then sees me it was all those yummy seasonings I can get into that kitchen magic I had this vision of actually look after the traffic cock in the turkey legs to rip it apart but the level of detail is mention I feel much more confident that that was truly for it folk magic I guess it was passed down to me I was always told that you should not haggle for a magical item so I've heard that one before he said in a court record  those things that's been brought to us from our ancestors I think that's probably something that you can spell the word they they actually read that way so I'm going to read you like oh oh oh yeah okay that sounds type of thing and you know those are things that folk magic the world round or so some of those you can like you said kind of clue you into which ones may possibly have a hint of Truth to them. Found them in other regions really like that the one that found in an English book of spelling and you know who do you can say about that is one that was widely used and practiced and that's that's one of the things that I find fascinating stories folk magic is that  you know somehow I think we've all kind of tapped into some sort of universal truth and a lot of these things because you story is in these these magical spells and ingredients show up in so many different places developed separately but they're all so close and similar and I just I love finding those I think that's absolutely fascinating so this is definitely a book to get Alpine witchery if you are interested in folk magic if you are interested in the history told in a fascinating and not text bookie way sorry she'll then you should  then this book isn't very fun read I highly recommend you check out Christians book check him out at any workshops are you coming up on any workshops you doing any more coming up Arthur talk and in June I have signed up for June 19th because I have they are wonderful that's great then the conference's is over 10 days a week and also so I don't know yet when I will find some information I will squeeze that out of our llewelyn people and pick some information up on the on the show notes for people to find that so they can sign up because we absolutely love your Workshop was a lot of fun and a lot of work out there next time I heard your podcast about the conference and I heard you guys talk about giving things to people  tarot cards if something has started with us doing that all the time with different things that we do is that I had gone to a few workshops at various places over the years when I was given a takeaway I was thrilled beyond belief like you give people a takeaway and there's something that sticks with him about you and I'm going to put a recommendation out here for you Christian please if you do decide to do a takeaway and you maybe you do ingredients from the spells in the book no Pig poo I just recognized he's thinking  it's not fair I said no  well thank you Christian so much for joining us we have had as usual a very enlightening and very fun time hanging out with you will definitely have you back on because there's so much more to talk about and we are so glad that you took the time and were able to chat with us tonight interesting yeah let's get together and then you're like by the way I will also be Sacred Space was one of the first synchronicities that we had a secret space but one of my favorites and thank you for coming to our Rachel there to that was very nice to see you  walking the dog that's my usual podcast time and I knew what I'm going to do be surprised everyone so all our listeners go check out next Workshop in person maybe you will to get a very cool take away that's not going to be paid for you I'll be there all right well thank you all so much for listening to it back on the broomstick and Christian thank you thank you thank you but my pleasure and honor and where they can find your next workshops online and in-person and all that and of course when I get copies of their book Thank you thank you so much to Christian Berner for joining us on back on the broomstick as always it was a very fun and interesting conversation I totally love him and folk Magic from around the world so aside from the fact that he's super great he's got some great content that is totally worth taking a look at and I know we keep saying it over and over again  this book has so much information and it's so much fun and so interesting to read and we're not just saying that it really really is interesting to read even if you're just interested in weird court cases get this book didn't have to be a witch to like this book there's so much in it and it's a damn textbook even though especially if you're a history buff this is a good one this is a good one in you know if you're into different Witch Trials again a good one so whether it's for your into ancient spells I mean I think I just saw today somebody was like hey what's the oldest grimoire of real spells this kind of is it you need to smoke pig poop please no nope nope not going to happen I smoke a lot of stuff not going to do  alright thank you again so much for listening please like subscribe give us some Stars give us some reviews really helps to show asking to make sure a little witches we will see you at next week same time same which channel keep it Wicked folks and please do not smoke the pig poop  not even on 420 keep it with Chi and pig poo free

back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode we're talkin about the celebration of Beltane this is a very old fire Festival rooted in ancient Celtic tradition and is traditionally celebrated on May 1st in our old Community for this Festival we would choose a mate queen and a making and on this episode shell and I are naming all of you if you choose to accept the May Queen and or making of This Beltane I'm Layla and let me be the first one to say all hail the queens and kings of the Mets and I'm queen Michelle because well were all queens and kings today's a holiday and I'm so excited to talk about it and it's not my favorite for all the reasons you might think this is a lot of people's favorite holiday is the beginning of Summer traditionally it's celebrated with fire and with dancing and with life and would love  send with all sorts of the things that we absolutely adore and what is the thing that we would do for the first time every year at Beltane I'm going to stop the nine-year-old boy from saying what I don't say that cuz that was camping  it's traditional starts with a camping season at least if you're in the Northeast this is like first camping weekend opportunity now that doesn't guarantee you're not going to wake up to snow outside your tent but I was going to say the same thing it's the first camping opportunity and you better bring three sleeping bags and 12 blankets because you might but we still did it anyway okay quick side note remember that time when we went to Beltane and camped and we woke up till like 4 in of snow and I begged you to go take me for hot chocolate  car in the wee hours of the morning and went out and got hot chocolate and coffee warm stuff it's May and snowing I think we came back and a whole bunch of other people were also walking back to the camping filled with steaming cups of coffee and warm croissants and it was definitely a chilly morning but great community so speaking of our community let's talk real quick because I know we're both excited about this our world community in Upstate New York kind of I don't want to say dormant but they went a little buy it and come South people had life things were going on they're bringing Beltane back they're bringing Beltane back man they are I was listening to a couple of our old belting episodes in a couple years ago I was very excited cuz we had just moved back to the east coast and our old community did a Beltane celebration and I went and it was so lovely to reconnect with some old friends meet new friends and then sadly  last year they didn't do it but this year it has been announced by one of our favorite parts of the community that will be happening now puts it out there then you know it's going to be a Rockin good time and I'm glad that we're doing it because that is the land where I met my husband 26 years ago that long it was and it was all your fault blame me I'll take that one I absolutely blame you there

listeners that are a part of that group and in the Southern Tier of New York when would I are going to Belton are they going to be excited or are they going to be worried that's the question here because of our listeners that are part of that Community yes we're coming at this is your fair warning I guess we're coming in with a bunch and I think they're going to be frightened and scared and joyful all at the same time that we did tend to push the envelope I don't think we ever did more than cause a few ruffled feathers with the old guard I wouldn't push an envelope and quiet that's exactly how he described you when you're not around we are not asking opinions on that we're just rolling and statement  is having a celebration and she'll and I will be there with bells on very joyous and very excited but looks talk about as far as you know we talked about community and we talked about all these wonderful group things that we do and have done what about our listeners that don't have that why don't we take a moment let's let's dedicate this episode to our solitary friend the kings and queens of the Mets that are all of our listeners this year all of you with whether you're celebrating with a cup in a group friends family or just by yourself this is things that you can do at home to celebrate yourself as royalty of the may as well as celebrate the season the God

crown on to be your Royal self or you can place it on the altar to remind you that you are royalty that you are sovereign of your own life I left now I am bursting to just chat about this real quick so we're going to we're going to walk into this conversation not everybody has the ability of the means the space the openness to be able to just have a ritual or a celebration privately in their yard their family home whatever let's talk briefly about how you recently were doing some May Day Celebrations you spent the afternoon you lucky dog you actually spent the afternoon with my grandson if I was  able to to babysit for a day so you did the things you did with my grandson were such made a things but it was kind of celebrate that spring the new life Outdoors you know the the freshness that is in the Beltane season talk to me a little bit about your little Beltane day fun with my little man well I'm an idiot and when you mentioned that your daughter was moving I was like I'll let her know if she needs any help I don't know why I said that because she been asked for help can you help him like I can't put Leila cat is a said she she offered me the best job which was babysitting I didn't even have to move shit I got to play with the baby all day so I get out there and this lovely house is your old haunted house it really is all my God we need a different episode we need to talk about if he felt anything in my old house  there was someone in the window I thought your daughter was there and the house was empty she showed up we'll talk about that now he's the perfect age let me just say by the way he turns 3 on Beltane weekend just egging  adorable this is your old house and it has a cute little backyard and a cute little front yard that was just bursting with flowers daffodils I mean I know that's kind of a spring thing but it's also more of a late spring or early summer thing with her we're at least bring the grass was green and has blooming in the backyard so I got to take your grandbaby out in the muddy backyard where it had just rained April showers and he loves picking the flowers he would pick the little purple deadnettle zand the violets and these little white flowers that I don't know what they were out of the grass weed say what color they were and he pick a couple and then what he really wanted to do was go over to the little forsythia bush and decorate it with these flowers that smiling bright yellow Bloom of these gorgeous bright yellow flowers which he loved but he wanted to decorate it with these little white and purple flowers so he picked a little flower  hours and he came over and you know tell me how pretty it was and how beautiful and and he really likes decorating it then we got to play in the mud because spring is mud luscious and may is very very full of rain in mods we got to play in the mud and enjoy all of that so being outside touching the dirt touching the new flowers we wove little flower crown waking it up cuz that house has been empty for a minute and I could tell that the land was happy and excited there was a family there again a family that it new and so that's one thing that you can do and belt 8 is say hello to your lands again as it's waking up say hello to those land spirits and I love getting to do that at your old house with your new grandbaby I did send you lots of pictures so so did you did you know that I actually ended up posting on Facebook the picture of him with behind the yellow flowers cuz it was so cute he's the sweetest  it wasn't just so we can spend a few minutes talking about my sweet baby the point of me bringing this up was even if you can't go out in the yard and cast The Circle because the neighbors might put you to the stake or something there such thing as you can do is a solitaire or with your children or with your family or what have you that doesn't necessarily have to be casting a circle calling cortisol it can still be ritualistic but your decorating trees and plants and digging in the mud and stones and weaving flower crowns and declaring your little grandbaby a little prince of the Mets she is and now what does being king or queen of the May mean we've declared all of our listeners are royalty in our old community that means Leila cuz I was a queen of the May and I was just going to point out that after like 20 years I still never was the damn McLean maybe this year  maybe maybe now our community the making and queen wasn't important tradition and in historically a lot of times when they chose someone to represent a season or to represent the holiday the idea is that person literally represents those energies they are that energy battery maybe for the community they bring that and provide it to everyone so the May Queen traditionally throughout the whole year would have represented that growth fertility that blooming coming into season and in our community to Queen in particular but the making of the May Queen held the energy of the community they helped to carry it and they helped to let it grow some people theorize that when the community kind of petered out towards the end of few years ago we had had a series of makings and queens who were chosen and then we're never able to come back and what we traditionally likes to do was we would put all of  is energy of the community into the making and queen celebrate them for the day give them gifts and then throughout the year they would hopefully come back to the community and bring that energy back and then the next Beltane they would give up that title to the next person and allow the energy to be carried on cycling exactly so I think that might have contributed a little bit to it but in our community it was done by chance they would bake a bean or something small into a cake or cupcakes or brownies and in those would be passed around and if you got the bean you are the queen of the May so historically there's not a lot of evidence for a May Queen but there were people that were symbols or hell those symbols of the season so even though the May Queen is like a central figure in modern Pagan and particularly Wiccan bass Beltane celebrations there's no real drift evidence that ancient  Egan's crowned any type of me Queen but her Roots do Trace back through folk Customs it was in a lot of older seasonal rights that we're kind of similar but not the same she was first mentioned we're pretty sure in the 19th century by a folklorist going to leave James Frazier and he linked the current May Day Celebrations to ancient fertility Cults and fertility Rites of older pagan people and these writings influenced a lot of the early wiccans like Gerald Gardner so the main Queen became this idea and expression of the season of the goddess in her Maidenform so in modern rights she is half of The Duality joined by the Green Man the horned God and they join together in the secret marriage that blesses the lands that brings Vitality back to the earth now what that means for our listeners is that they get to carry this energy of New Life of new beginnings of create  send within themselves for their own practice or for whatever purpose they choose to put it to sometimes people have a lot of just the magic of one for the time being and we're celebrating Beltane in the Northern Hemisphere and they're celebrating Samhain in the Southern Hemisphere and these are the two big holidays of the year and they both represent Duality life New Beginnings the god the goddess and while Beltane is celebrating life in full bloom basically the seeds you planted are really starting to come out now that one's kind of the opposite of bad it's when those things are dying off and things are going to pasture so to say right now right no I'm not saying to go there I'm just saying that these are two sides of the same coin just to do Alex and I love celebrating duality of the energies  action and reception of masculine feminine if you choose to call them that they Encompass so much more than just that and just like it sound when the veil is thin just because we call it Beltane doesn't mean that the veil is thick here in the Northern Hemisphere and thin down in the southern hemisphere it's been everywhere so ancestor work and divination is really good this time of year and that's why you saw Claire at my old family home because he knows we love spending and she's got stuff to say Beltane is a fertility holiday It's Fashion it's about sacred unions as god and goddess and and we've been working a lot with the horned God lately if you can leave here knew no sin this is a wonderful time to celebrate the horned God literally and figuratively just saying maybe because a lot of us have Hang-Ups from other religions I'm not sure but I think the god tends to get forgotten and I love to make sure that he's remembered on Beltane  wild Layla Layla wants to Remember the Time belt change  I'm surprised he knows the wild god of the wood the Green Man pan turn all of these Gods goat-footed Gods horns Gods Gods who walk around with their ding dong out these guys I love these guys this time of year because they love being Wild and Free and that energy is beautiful and it is wrong and it is you feel it across the land you do and I grew up in the woods my father is a Woodsman and false he may have honoring the woods and the spirit of the Woods has always been a part of who he is and so I have always felt the wild heartbeat of the god in the woods and in the land especially this time of year so if you get a chance say hello to Karen Uno's spend a little time learning about her nor pan or one of the green men learn about the wild ways  the forest and the path Walker's don't forget the guy he is such a big part you know the God within us we all have these Duality spell teens all about Duality and you don't need a separate person to have that to ality you can find that in yourself so set the Godfrey that's in you when you're celebrating the making and the May Queen you do be both of them and celebrate that guy celebrate that Wild and Free Spirit and definitely Revel in that for a little bit and allow that to be wondrous and honoring and beautiful because he is not about control or putting down he is about running those tabs and being part of Nature and being part of the cycle and it's not about domination it's about Duality absolutely and it's about honoring the life-giving force in himself in the world in the goddess and everything he's beautiful and powerful and I I  highly recommend you guys say hello LG is makes me want to just jump out of my chair and go outside and go say hello to God he's the god of the sun god of healing and light and Beltane typically means the fires of bell you know so just to interject here a little bit I read an article recently now we've talked about this before we got on to record and I am the worst person at pronunciations so I'm going to give this ago so I read an article based out of Edinborough way to teach me pronunciations is to invite me to come stay  oh that would be awesome wouldn't that would be awesome if they do every year which I love this and I find this fascinating to actually would love to attend sometime they do a Beltane fire festival and they have actually what's come of the Beltane fires society that puts this big huge I mean they like balefire is it almost looks almost looks ancient to me when you watch these YouTube videos like you're transported back in time to traditional Beltane celebrations but the town has actually put a ticket levy on this event what what is that it's basically a tax and they're saying that the implications by putting on this tax levy gives to the city at the ability to hold a safe cultural and community of Base defense all for it  is the way they have kind of structured who has to pay this tax levy and who doesn't is kind of not in favor of the Beltane fire Society so it seems to be a little discriminatory it's kind of targeted yeah okay yeah basically what they're saying is if you have an event at this place and you're going to have things like fire and you're going to have say more than 100 people you have to pay this exorbitant tax directly targeted to them but they're not saying you and you alone are tax so they're making it kind of exclusive instead of inclusive and they've added this part I guess it's called but it'll probably go to pronounce this wrong as well good Calton Hill they've added it to the premier Parks events they have this thing called Premier Parks event Levi project  basically kind of targets certain groups to charge him a lot and so this group has been targeted right and they're saying that you know obviously I was with anything else that this is going to put a strain on the facilitation and the attendance so I mean I'm not saying that they're trying to drive him out but kinda I mean this thing has more than twenty thousand attendees so like we're not talking like two hundred people here we're talking over like 20,000 attendees I guess I need to know a little more I can understand having some safety and place and needing to have permits and that kind of thing I totally get that this feels very targeted so I hope not it's coming across and I mean this was right on msn.com not that they're the premier news source but it's not like I got this out of like the local PennySaver it looks like the fyre festival itself very cool it's been going on since 1988 and I would absolutely love to go next year  but they do fire spinning there's all sorts of events that go on all night they have rituals they have fire displays they're going to have a torch-lit procession symbolic figures from Celtic mythology the Green Man the queen of the May will be there I can just see the Rihanna and are of caution with all that fire going around but you know why don't you just don't understand by if that's the case I would hope that this is not religiously targeted and it's really just to keep everything safe and if they work with the local people that are are in Scotland and Edinboro and I would like to know a if you go is this a badass time or what and B is the tendons and is the event going to actually be that affected with the targeted attack on pricing because this is some time is what governments do  assistance my last question to that is pink that was either C or D or 4 I'm not sure how soon should we start looking for Rooms To Reserve at the local hotels cuz it looks like there's a lot of people that go to this just saying I had to say that so there are celebrations around the world for this you know we all like when the days are longer and warmer and you can see that life has started we even had a hard time celebrating ostara until just a couple weeks ago because it's it's been so cold and yucky this is wonderful this year I feel like I'm really blooming and really ready to be outside in our region of the world I've always looked at summer and I know you've kind of always looked at summer is summer is from Belton to Samhain a great and it is time to kick it up folks  ancient Ireland this is one of those holidays but has been celebrated for a very very long time and we do know what these celebrations are there is a I think it was in the tenth Century CarMax glossary sinus Cormac 10th Century Irish text he describes the festival is taking place on May 1st and it was typically the start of summer so I seen this as the summer season May 1st to Fallon even in cold Northeast is historically accurate I believe that in Ireland in Irish and may is the Altoona so some people will sit instead of saying Beltane for the holiday Phil call it by the Altoona which is the word from the month of May that were said to come to Ireland so honoring the Fey folk is another way a traditional way to celebrate Beltane and that goes hand-in-hand with go out and walk your land walk around your neighbor  find a tree in your backyard and leave a little offering of milk or honey or a tiny little bit of food for the Fey go say hello to your land Spirits I have been loving the last few weeks walking a mile and anytime I get a chance go out and pick up some of the branches that have fallen start cleaning the land getting my garden beds ready and Whispering hello and waking up the land spirits and then it's a wonderful thing to do for Beltane as well know you were talking about how how it has it goes by different names and Welsh it's called Colin mine and one thing I have always associated with Beltane and I think of when I think of calling my is to remember when you are kid the little wicker baskets and you to go pick flowers have a ton to Spanish Fork Utah wicker baskets all I can think about the other day was just going through with my wicker basket and filling it with flowers for what reason I don't know just cuz they  all pretty I'm not good at weaving flower crowns that's really kind of your thing but just kind of bring in that life inside to the house cuz this is traditionally my spring cleaning time where I kind of got everything cleaned it all out and bringing a basket of fresh flowers and kind of I don't know I don't want to see rejuvenate fresh cuz those aren't the words that really sound right but something they are their perfect rejuvenating my space and I am working hard to keep these plants alive by the way people and everything is going swimmingly right now leaving crowns or weaving reads to put up on your door you know take down your old Reece that was for fall or winter and put a nice spring wreaths that smells good has some Greenery in it but weaving is wonderful and Maples are not a good example of weaving you know that kind of brings me around to some I did want to chat about today  ribbon magic you know not everybody is familiar with a maypole and the ribbons on a maypole and the other day I saw something on Facebook that talked about Maples and all I could think about was dancing around that pole and weave in the ribbon and I don't have that right now but I still want the concept of that and because I I didn't have that that big community in that 10 ft tall made Paul to dance around took different colored ribbons to Spring colored ribbons I had a pink and yellow and white and blue and did like a for ribbon braid I took that braids and actually ended up attaching it to my broomstick a shout out to The Hags over a stream on Chromecast burn Monica  and all of you that love them and send them energy sending lots of good wonderful energy cuz they're fantastic creators and they're so good the other creators in the space which is wonderful which has any way to put it on your broom to my broom because it was kind of a spontaneous thing that I I was doing it without really knowing why I just didn't really have a y at the end so I put it I just put it in the flower stems how you do the flower crown version of French braiding if anybody out there has a hard time breathing flower crowns if you think of it like French braiding where you're always adding a little bit more hair or whatever to the parade as you go along it's basically you just add new flowers to the Pro Bowl on  sing magic. Magic this time of year when I don't really any other time of year so I think of this time of year is kind of time to be weaving magic together figuratively and literally when we talked before about not magic and weaving magic as you're doing the spell each of those braids or not holds the energy so you can braid as your as your humming a spell eraser thinking about the energies you could do each not to be at a different word of the spell or a different energy that you want to hold and Maples are I'm not sure exactly when they started getting associated with Beltane but because they have a lot of fertility associations they've definitely been part of may-day and Beltane celebrations not just for pagans but Christians and other people do Maple dances as well and now in our community and in a lot of communities the maypole and the ribbons are fertility symbols which again is a big huge theme of Beltane so the maypole obvious  he stands for the phallus and the hole that the pole goes into stands for the vagina so you have male and female aspects I know I make it sound so unsexy or literally would champ with the hall and Hall oh yeah I was there was all sorts of innuendos flying back and forth we had a lot of fun with it I'm hoping it happens again this year so it doesn't again is a fertility thing you put the pool in the hole and the ribbons can stand for all sorts of things they can stand for the Maiden Blood they could stand for semen they can stand for just the energies of the season and so to do a simple Maple spell you would get ribbons in the colors that you want colors that represent Beltane which is typically going to be like green gold red silver things that you would see when you go outside this time of year and also pick colors that represent what you want maybe you're going to put purple in there because you are the God damn made Queen this year and you're royalty so you want to put purple in there to represent your royalty as you  hold your head up and wear your crown for the rest of the year but in our community everyone would get a ribbon we typically use the same ones each year and the May Queen we get a white one the only white one because we would all try to dance and weave the ribbons beautifully and the chaos and she would weave in and out however she wanted to while the rest of us tried to do the pattern perfect and we would do a little bit of maple divination at the end where we would see how chaotic or how the pattern woven kind of predict how the year would go based on the maypole weaving tongue and cheek mostly you can do that yourself if you had a group or if you wanted to do a little knitting or crocheting or weaving yourself as you spoke your spouse and just kind of look at it afterwards and see how it turns out that might give you an idea I've always liked to be weaving intentions into the coming season because I kind of have that theme on every Sabbath every holiday is kind of stuff  sing the intentions for the next segment the next Notch that were working with you know so what it what are my intentions that I'm going to set from now from Beltane until we had left side of the summer solstice what are my goals and in what am I looking to accomplish basically between the beginning of May in the end of June you know so I kind of I like that weaving my intentions for this this next phase of the wheel because sometimes my brain just can't chunk it out a year at a time sometimes I just need to go every six weeks you know what you want for the next six weeks for the next eight weeks from now because I don't have to have space for that I can only kind of segmented out for the here and now and I think that may be a lot of people are feeling that way I recently that I can only think about the  next week's dammit I can't next six months yeah I have a little spell that will kind of combined that idea into a short-term spell from now until Alyssa however many strands you would like 347 whatever kind of rating or not work you would like to do but make sure that it is natural fibers or paper or long strands of grass you can use whatever you want just make sure that it's natural because I going to put this outside this is going to be an offering to yourself from now until Lissa and also to the land spirit so one of the things people used to do for Beltane is to tie ribbons usually there would be a special tree off of near water or in a place where they filled the land Spirits were particularly potent to be like a fairy tree and that would be where people would go to tie ribbons and ask for an offering you know they might leave a little bit of food or honey or milk for the land Spirits for the FAE and they would tie the ribbon and ask for something in return  so in this version of the spell you're going to take your three ribbons you can take like that really thin paper anything you'd like again natural and as you think of what you want three that into the three things you're braiding If It's Paper you can write on it if you want to but speak your wishes to those three strands and then as you're braiding it concentrate on what it is you're asking for a new job I want to see the great fertility time if you want to have a new baby if you want to start something new if you want to bring fertility of whatever flavor into your life this is a great time to ask for it so ask for these things as you braid have to be long very short so Brazier little three things together and then go to your fairy treat whatever outside space you have chosen to be your fairy Bush say your intention one more time and then tie that ribbon on to the tree and then leave an offering of milk or honey and you can say something very simple I love rhyming things you might say something like with this ribbon I give my wish  belief to wind with blossoms kiss May the spirits of the land receive and in their time I will believe or something they would ever say something reimy that fits with what you like doesn't matter or just say thank you and then turn around and walk away and leave it and there's your little offering to the FAE and your little belting tree wish and your little dab of Honey is an offer like you mentioned one time using Acorn caps and I love that it is so cute little tiny flowers of offerings whatever you'd like but yeah so you're wishing to that little braids tie it to the tree and then leave your offering and go. Kind of sounds like my little grandson putting his little flowers and that's what I was thinking of while we while we were doing that I was thinking that he was making little offerings to the land and that made me think of that old Beltane tradition of Thai  things to know about you so I thought about that so you could say that this is your grandbabies spell people traditionally would like to fires and walk through them you know everyone would put out all their fires in their homes and they would like to fires up on a hill by the town and people would drive their cattle between the two fires in order to bless them to give fertility they themselves would walk through the fires you could do that at your house with two candles or if you're lucky enough to have a fire outside you could set a candle a few feet away from that fire to be your second fire or used to read crystals or two drawings of fire two phones with videos of fires burning on them. And then State your intention that these are your bell fires and you're going to walk through these Bell fires and receive the blessing of the God of Light and life and fertility for the coming year  you could pass your items between them like your tools your jewelry your pets bless your grimoire bless your baby whatever just be safe remember your fire safety that sounds perfect especially for folks that don't have a group and don't have a large community to lean on that's the perfect way for them to celebrate solitary to it's pretty cool and there's lots of fire things that you can do just be careful with the fire don't burn your house down. Time we were to Beltane and someone jumped the Beltane fire and caught on fire like we don't need that we don't thankfully in our group there were people right there that took care of that because stop drop and roll folks very often we would jump the fire so times we had two fires that you could walk through but in in our defense when there was fire jumping we always had a fire spotter so if you did have freely close on it happened to catch fire there  somebody they're beaten into the ground I think it only happened once and it was scary scary absolutely fire  some other things that you can do for Beltane Beauty spells and glamour spells and if you go out at dawn or early morning before the do burns off the morning dew of Beltane is said to have special powers you can take a washcloth or a piece of cloth outside wipe the grass or maybe wipe your window if it's got do on it I don't know you can put that on your face you can put that in a little vial and add it to beauty and love so you can add a little bit of it to your bath but they're the first do of the morning of May 1st is said to have magical properties on Beltane morning when the Dew is out so that that magic is something I'm not familiar with the deal will have burned off by the time she is out of bed  do all of our makings and queens we recommend that you braid a crown for yourself maybe set up a throne set up a throne with your squishy blankets or with your favorite pillow or you do make it look Royal Rico have whatever that means to you set up a spot this specifically for you in your home make your alter into a throne room and celebrates the DVD that royalty that's within you to the make Angus in the Mets Queens thank you so much for listening to this Beltane episode of back on the broomstick all of our kings and queens of the Met out there and thank you all so much for being with us for hangout for celebrating these Seasons we really appreciate you guys and you know we're just want y'all to just get outside breathe some fresh air it's been a few months and we finally finally can go out and enjoy that that is nature it's time to go out in the woods it's time to go to the water get out  my folks  play the play the month like my grandson without and within each other I guess I'm starting to sound like a sermon anyway thank you all again so much for joining us we hope you get a chance to enjoy this Beltane and we will see you all soon for the next episode being wise be royal be Wicked and keep it with she cleans

services on her website YouTube channel and through several books and her most recent book is how to read and interpret a birth chart guideposts for understanding natal astrology and I'm Michelle and this is going to be the most confused I am in episode ever guys I am very excited I am I am interested in astrology but it is definitely far for my forte so Lori we welcome you to the show and tell us a little bit about yourself and your astrology background before we kind of dive into the nitty-gritty well I am delighted to be here let me say that  1st and astrology has just always been my passion from the time I think I was 7 years old the first time I saw the symbols on a little book by the grocery store checkout I remember those I saw those when I like I said when I was about seven years old and I don't know what it was but the symbols themselves just called to me really loudly and I begged and pleaded with my mother to buy me those little little tiny books And I memorized everything I couldn't you know I have spent the rest of my life since then chasing those symbols I knew there was something in them that I had to understand so that's that's where it all began it's amazing how sometimes these things can really reach out and call to us even when we don't understand what they are I have no idea it's like one of those little squiggly lines and what do they mean  astrology has always been one of those esoteric Pursuits that you would see regularly it was commonplace the sea magazines like that you know in the supermarket and you would see people's horoscopes in the newspaper and in magazines all the time I mean since the 80s has been very common to see astrology around but I think a lot of us realize after first reading horoscopes if there's more to it than the superficial this is what your daily horoscope means and you know I think that diving in beyond that that superficial is where you really start to get into the interesting parts of astrology absolutely people tend to think you know I'm a Sagittarius or I'm an Aries or whatever the sun sign is they tend to think that's who they are and that's such a tiny piece of it and you know what's interesting cuz there is there's many astrology shawl over the world there's Indian astrology this Vedic astrology you know what we're talking about here is Western astrology it is  not based on the constellations it's based on the seasons it's very much based on the seasons and you know there's just what you hear about astrology in today's world you're here a lot about what's called mundane astrology which is what's going on in current time you do people tend to know when Mercury is retrograde or when they're going to flip some kinds different ways of looking at it and my focus really is natal astrology which comes from the moment you took your first breath you bring in the energy of the patterns at that moment in time I think of you know astrology really is a study of time and I think of there being a river of time that goes by  and when we take that first breath it's like that split-second of time is removed from the river of time and hand it to you and it's your job to incorporate the gifts and the challenges that were inherent in that moment that's pretty deep that was one of your book to take it back to your book for just a second because it was like a workbook for me but I'm going to say that in the beginning you talked a lot about cycles and finding the Cycles in the stars and bringing those Cycles back to Earth so it struck me when you said that Western astrology follows the seasons it went back to you talking about the cycle and that resonates with me as a witch because we're very connected to Cycles in so many different levels and I didn't know that about Western astrology I didn't realize that it was cyclical like that can you explain that a little bit a lot of people follow and understand the cycle the lunar cycle  you know you got the new moon goes to the first quarter of the Full Moon the last quarterback to the Numa so that's the lunar cycle but you can expand that out and any two planets has a similar cycle so you could take like I don't know Venus and you're honest and when they come together it's like a new moon only it's those two planets cycle to all of the pairs of planets are creating their own cycles that are impacting our individual birth charts and we're born in the midst of a whole series of different Cycles  it is complicated. Why do I feel like an in and you haven't mentioned this yet but here's my fear with I know nothing about astrology other than I'm a Gemini and boy does she know it I feel like there's a lot of math involved is that true or is that just one of those Scare Tactics things back in the day there was a lot of math involved we had to sit down and you know Char all this stuff it was very very complicated in today's world we plug the information into the computer and it giving it gives us the information that you know you can you can work with the math of it but you don't really need them anymore so someone like me who is absolutely scared of math not my forte at all. Because me and math are like know and I felt like if you're not  good at math you're not going to be good at astrology that's absolutely not true yeah you might come into places that are a little confusing but you don't need to know that, okay even I mean I work with people who know absolutely nothing about astrology one of the things that I've really focused on is my desire has always been make this usable to anyone it doesn't need to be you know there's a lot of astrologers I think that have had this like you know we're special and we have the special knowledge that no one else can come near to I don't like that I want to make this I know what astrology has done for me in my life it has enabled me to become a decent human being you know seriously when I was young I was not a very nice person  and knowing astrology and using it to understand myself and other people just cracked me open in a way that I want people to be able to understand and love themselves and other people through this perspective that astrology gives us and we don't need to complicate it in huge ways you know you can get as complicated as you want with astrology but you know if you read somewhat my book I got the best compliment about my book recently from an old student that studied with me at my kitchen table like 35 years ago and she wrote to me she said I just read your book and I felt like I was sitting at your kitchen table and that just meant so much to me cuz that's what I wanted when I wrote the book I was writing it to my students  I was writing it to people that want to really understand the natal chart now I'm going to add to that and I'm going to say yes it does feel like I'm sitting at your kitchen table but only if you're a very serious Professor who has a lot of knowledge to impart and is giving me a lot of information because I I don't know a lot about astrology and I did read through this book and it was not easy but it was so good and I really love that you included charts of famous people we found lizzo and who else would we find Shell I found the rising information for Janis Joplin what made it really actually accessible for me I'm not going to say easy because that's the wrong word was that you have these charts in here and so when it finally started to click for me was when I would take these parts or my charge is generating like you said a free one that I could look at and then going back and reading the passage and relating it to the chart that I was  so I did have to do that it made more sense to me when I could look at it right on that chart and then it started to click and as I went through the book I was starting to see it not so much as math and rising signs but more like a Tarot spread more like a charm casting spread or tasseography I started to see in these pictures where they were sitting in their houses where they lay on just like in a Tarot spread how they've created a story how they wove together a narrative so your book is not easy yes sitting at your kitchen table sounds fun but it's a lot of work and so I did start to get it but it did take working through it but it it's starting to make sense and be very cool in that way to me so thank you if you're interested in understanding your own chart if you've got a copy of your chart in whole Sign House system I want to just reiterate that there's different house systems many so many and whole sign makes  much less dependent on knowing that I mean that's one of the one of the reasons I started working with whole Sign House system is it it's easier and after working with different house systems over many years you don't lose anything it makes it a lot easier and it's just as powerful I love it it makes things a lot easier and a lot less dependent on math I mean ya know if you were going to say you knew nothing cuz Layla is actually a step above me in astrology knowledge not saying much you know everybody pretty much knows the sign they were born under if they just wanted to kind of scratch the surface and get in any particular things they should focus on like I remember 20-30 years ago the big thing was knowing you're rising and what that meant if you knew your birth sign your Rising your son your moon you don't  is there a scratching the surface starting point or is this just a dive all in and get all the houses and just go For Broke at I'm you really do and Sun Moon and Rising are the basic place to start okay and if you know you know you can take those three pieces the sun is the core of who you are the Moon is your emotional nature your greatest need of the personality and the rising sign is sort of how people see you kind of mask that you wear not a mask to hide behind but the mask that allows you to show up in the world in a authentic way and if you know those three things you can kind of go out from there you know the way to think of it is there's the planets each planet is a particular piece of who we are we can think of it as the planets are our internal teachers  and the signs that they're in our the method they used to teach us and then the houses are different areas of life so wherever the planet lands it's teaching you with the method of the sign in that area of your life you know you can come to create the thing where you can just make little sentences of these different parts of we are complicated incredibly complicated I know I'm relating it to Tara because that's the system I'm most familiar with the boy is this an awful lot like a Tarot spread Planet putting it into a particular pattern and not me but it's really very much like tarot I love how you talk about it that way cuz you know I work sometimes with just thinking about the house ask your rooms inside of us a different things he's different energies and if it is you can definitely look at it similar to  tarot spread and if you think of taking that one breath as your board it's a troll spread that holds the entire focus of your life that but I have a question so with Terrell you know I kind of look at Terrell as this is where you're at in the path you're on right at the moment of this spread and you could take a left turn in 20 minutes and it could all change but this kind of War sounds like like the old saying it's written in the stars are you just destined to live out what all of this says or is there are you asking the Free Wheeler fate question to them know you're not you're not as yes your natal chart your birth chart is your chart it is your job to work with that however from that moment you breathe in that first moment the planets are set  their patterns but from that moment on the planets keep moving and as they move they interact with your chart so you have opportunities all throughout your life to work with these deep inner parts of yourself the parts are still the parts but when a planet comes along and says okay it's time right now this year in the year 2025 you have an opportunity to explore whatever your moon your emotional nature then you have choices on how you work with that okay changes the trajectories the whole conversation is fascinating because I think that there is an element of Faith because we're born at this moment we've chosen I think we've chosen this moment to come in we've chosen these lessons to take on how we respond  when were called upon to act on them is up to us it's up to us to me one of the things that my friend any day and I have started doing we've got a YouTube channel I've seen it I love it by the way charts makes so much more sense watching you guys break down different people's charts and talk about things and it's very good we just started the series of the famous people and we did we did Donald Trump we did Cory Booker right after he did his 25 hour AMC recently you should we do next because we're making a few more this week we haven't decided on who yet Anders can't find a birth time for him and I know him because I've lived in Burlington I was there when he became mayor of Burlington in 1981 I've known Bernie since 1981 and I actually asked his wife couple years ago  if she would give me his birth, she wouldn't I have a confession I don't know my birth time I have a gas that was given to me but my mother confessed that she made it up so I'm in the process of getting my long form birth certificate but I don't have it yet how does that impact peoples chart totally what should I do well the time of birth is crucial for really deep work there are ways you can work with a chart without a birth time you lose certain things there's still a lot of information there's still a lot of information what you do if you don't have a birth time is you just create the chart at the moment the sun is rising on that day and that's called a sunrise chart tails and you know if you were born in this country by law  the time is on the original long form however if you just contact the whatever Department of Vital Statistics and just say I want a copy of my birth certificate what they actually will send you is a registration of birth not the long-form that's exactly what I ran into as I do have official copy of my birth certificate but they are not the long-form they do not have the time you have to really contact a human being that you can talk to and I'll just order it online and be really clear you want the long form the original that has the time on it and you know I've talked to some people that just somehow get dumb lucky and get a hold of somebody says oh I'll check it and just give them time I was hoping for that but thankfully it's only a couple hours away from here and I have family and a good reason to go there so I'm lucky enough I can go get it I just don't have it now  I have the opposite my mother was a pack rat and back in the seventies and the town I was born and they actually put your time on your original birth certificate and my sweet pack ready mother has never never lost our birth certificates weed so I actually am now have my original that was issued to my parents at my birth and it has the time on it so I didn't even have to get like the whole long and process it just happened to be on the original because that's what they did in my town back in the 70s on little factoids the time that I was given as my birth which again was admittedly made up with 7:41 a.m. so what time were you born I was born at 7:41 p.m. isn't that funny you're too charts we're really interested I was just so many links oh that's interesting no wonder they do a podcast they left  each other a lot and you have to say Yes actually that is been that has been through our whole friendship we do not have a lot that's very true I'm not surprised one other place that's really almost always you can trust to be really accurate with the time is for parents that keep baby books people are very specific when they fill in that baby book so if you can't find a birth certificate easily look for baby book I didn't even spend mostly documented that in several different locations including a baby book children children's charts and mothers charts are so amazing to work with together we think we know our children. Boy it's really amazing to get the perspective of who our children are it helps us to raise them so much sweetheart  we think we know we don't laugh because like I said I'm a Gemini and my daughter is one of those people that was born on a day that they call a cusp so my daughter is a Libra Libra Scorpio on the cusp and she is just like her Gemini mother because of that it is very interesting the cost of an interesting thing because his kind of shorthand for we really don't know I was going to say I explain what a customer with the time of your birth allow you to decide which one it is yes absolutely the thing that the whole idea is because you know most people don't especially back back in time people don't know exactly the moment the sun moves that you know it's not like oh the book says the sun is in the sign from this date to that day and exactly at midnight the sons of you know obviously the Sun and its movement through the signs doesn't go by midnight  exactly and if your born before that 2:40 to your one sign if you're born after that 242 you're the other son is one of the reasons people you know I hear people so much it's like I know I'm on the cusp cuz I can feel both signed so clear in me well that's probably because there's some other planet in that other side you know the Sun Mercury and Venus never move very far away from each other because they are between us and the sun when we look at it from our perspective they're always close to the Sun they never are opposite the sun they're always close to it so if you think you're on the cusp between Scorpio and Libra well you probably have mercury in one in the sun in the other or you know Venus my sister I grew up I was the youngest of five kids but I think one of the reasons I was so obsessed with astrology was trying to  stand up crazy dysfunctional huge family and trying to make sense of the people I lived with and I had one sister who all the books told me she was a Libra I thought she was a Libra sign somewhere in my thirties I finally like ran an actual copy of her charm. She was a scorpion was like oh no wonder she made so much more sense like no wonder she never was a Libra so yeah but the thing is always interesting I found that people who feel like they don't identify with their sons sign off and do with like a rising or maybe they're Moon does that have something to do with how their personality expresses themselves because you mentioned like son is who you are rising is how you present yourself and moon is your inner self with your emotions roughly roughly could it be that they may be identified with that another side of themselves more strongly yeah there's a lot of things that can fax you know there's  the time of day you were born people born at night the sun is below the surface and it's not as outwardly expressed people during the daytime it's more outwardly Express it's like Jenny and I that do the YouTube videos together we've known and worked with each other for so many years we both our sun sign Leo but she's a night Leo and I'm a day Leah and we kind of get a laugh about that a lot I'm a lot more out in the world and she's a lot more internal and you know we're both Leo's but if you met us I probably show up more Leo then she does see since I'm up like an aquarius sun and moon Aquarius rising and I think I've got a couple more aquarius's in there does that explain why I am so much an aquarius probably I do remember you had a lot of Aquarius do you remember if your mark is your mercury in Aquarius  you look when we were looking at mine at one point I think my moon is Aquarius and I think you both had a bunch of Aquarius to make spend my other child all over my chart okay so one of you is moon in Aquarius that's okay moon in Aquarius has sun and mercury and ascendant Aquarius oh well we don't really know because you don't have a hundred percent sure so we don't know your birth time but the Mercury Mercury in Aquarius is one of my favorite things to see what does that mean when Mercury is your mind your thought process is how you think what you think about you know how your mind works and Aquarius is  yes we are Aquarius is the sign of genius and not in terms of the highest IQ going but the ability for the mind go places that nobody taught it to go so that's why I was a bookworm always go down rabbit holes and Aquarius is all about Innovation it's the ability to see into the future of the ability to go into the future I had my son who's 35 years old now his Mercury was in Aquarius and I always think about him I might have even written about it in the book but when he was like seven years old had this huge piece of poster board and he was trying all these intricate little symbols and like what are you doing and he said I'm solving the problem the how did she say it and solving the transportation  albums of humanity with magnet Theory where do you get these ideas and screwed up his mind and I see people with Mercury in Aquarius sometimes can lose other people feel like you're talkin talkin talkin people are following you and all this and it's like where'd she go just went somewhere where and with your shell your moon in Aquarius emotionally you can follow her thinking intellectually be following her thinking but emotionally totally keep up  that sells Mercury is in Gemini I feel like we're the most discriminated like group of people people think you're like do you like to gather information I do you're going to follow her thinking because you're just gathering information you know they're both AR sign so they're both intellectual signs Gemini is an aquarius. Both are signs both intellectual signs and the difference is that the Aquarius is innovating going to the Future and the Gemini's just gathering information just gathered and then figure out what to do with it later that must be why we keep making you describe the first thing I thought when I looked at the two charts it's like oh they know how to work together on that level and go that's always been true a million things there  you know the last 10 or 15 years we've kind of is Pluto a planet is it not a planet are we going to keep it or we not do you count Pluto indefinitely Or what do you say about the people who leave it off the chart because it doesn't count as a planet anymore anyone who does who leaves It Off the Chain off the chart because it doesn't count as a planet anymore I don't know where I don't doesn't answer thank you like traditional traditional Western astrology that only use the planets Sun through Saturn because that's what it was based on before we found these other outer planets Pluto as a planet definitely it's one of the outer planets it has more to do with you know it's a generational plan  it has more to do with the outer bigger picture but no Pluto's planet Pluto the planet of power on team Pluto planet as well so lately when I started saying Pluto wasn't a planner it's like what the heck it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what they say I agree it's what's working and it's been working so where am I going to let it go I was looking through your book it's very workbook e and it's right next to me cuz I feel like I want to explore my whole thought process of doing these readings by looking at the charts and I'm really intrigued by it but other than journaling that type of progress that type of learning progress is there something that I or our listeners could do on a daily or weekly you know some type of regular basis where they can get in touch with it with this energies of Their Stars Beyond looking at the grocery store horoscope section make an appointment understand  some real understanding talk to a real professional astrologer I I think that you know aside from studying for a long long time that's the place to start really I I do a lot of mentorships with people as well I do consultations like consult with people all over the world around their natal chart around what's going on in current time impacting them and also the piece that I love to do more than anything right now is helping people understand themselves and the people they live through this perspective not necessarily you know everybody doesn't need to learn astrology to this great depth but if you find an astrologer who is able to really help you understand the core of what the natal chart tells you and the difference it can make in your  Shep's you know I have two different mentorship programs one is for people that want to learn astrology and one is for people who want to learn about themselves and the people they love and that's what I love to do more than anything is help introduce you to your children to your mother to your you know whoever when when I you know I have this process that I go through and I go 1-2-3 in I basically the the guideposts in the book I do that process with a chart and I get to a point where I feel the person and I know them in this very intimate place and at one time I was probably in my thirties I picked up my mother's chart and I did the process and when I got that feeling I was like what the hell is that that's not my mother  and I went from there to interviewing All My Siblings about who they thought their mother was  and it was as though we each had a different mother because we all see people from our filters and then taught me so much about you know how little we know the people in our lives and if I can help introduce people to the people they love and help them understand who they're really working well it's a very powerful gift I love that that's beautiful and that that is a fantastic way to bring this in into personal life and an even just on a more superficial level I mean you can do that and it's such a cheap way but I mean she'll and I have had lots of conversations just talking about her being a Gemini and leaving an Aquarius and what that means about our relationship and just in kind of a fun way but I understand her better after having those conversations  and when you meet someone and and they tell you what their sun sign is almost everybody's excited tell you what their sign is and if you know just a little bit about that they're basically trying to share a part of themselves with you there trying to say this is who I am that you might not see right away but I'm such an Aquarius and you can get an idea of what they're like from that and so I think that even if you don't want to work the math is Scary or it's not interesting to you if you just interested in just a few of those little Parts I can really help you find so many connections with people whether it's people in your family that you can learn another side of like you did with your mother you learned many different pieces of her or someone that you just met at a party it can be a way to get to know them and kind of talk to them and and find that connection and if you want to go to the next step after the sun is the moon you know because the Moon is our emotional nature and you know if you meet somebody and you can't make any sense out of their emotions  nature it's you know you won't understand that I mean between the two of you that's the one piece that's a little oddly off his arm around your moons yeah because shows moon is it aquarius so it's that intellectual like there's a way in which the emotional nature is kind of cool it's cool there's a little bit of Detachment there and then he was known as in Virgo that's very different Virgo is really service-oriented they're grounded so you know one of you is very grounded emotionally one of you is very intellectual emotionally that's where things might like not always feel totally aligned interested in you know I mean we all know relationships can have every piece that works right there's always going to be something that and that's what makes us curious about each other I think you know I think that my Virgo  South which is very different than the than the Aquarius nature kind of helps keep me a little grounded and I think that helps me connect a little more with shell sometimes because she can be very good about the list and the note taking and taking care of things and I relate my Virgo side relates to that very well where is her aquarium Moon allows her to let go and be a little more wild and a little more emotional and out there with me I think so maybe that kind of helps us in different areas I love Virgo it's a good sign that has a bad reputation I know nothing of something came up in my mean to me cuz I don't know what that conversation that's a big conversation but no little access kind of tells us the the Soul's purpose okay  okay that's a different podcast we'll have you back we'll talk about sole purpose of many things there's so many ways to look at these things that you know we can find ways to look at however you want to look at it whether you want to look at it as past lives or ancestral lives and how they impact us you know there's just so much available astrology is like one big onion and you can just keep peeling back those layers further and further however you want to go like so many things you know like what you guys do with really going in and understanding is levels of witchy Ness and Witchcraft and I mean there's no end to those layers that's good point you know I said that to someone recently I said you know this is one of the things that I love the most about astrology if I can study this everyday  my life from the time I was 7 years old until however long I live and I never will get bored or never come to an end and that person was talking to look at me as he isn't that the same with everything and I started thinking actually anything that's worth putting our passion into is going to open up those layers layers do still feel like you learn new things strategy after all this time yes I feel like I learn new things about my own Char yeah it's what keeps getting deeper and they don't stay still they don't stay still and as they move they change the change our perspective on our own internal processes you know most people I work with i c m at least every six months and over time there is really an ability to track the cycles and see what's being opened at this period of time and what's being shown  at this period of time so what you're saying is it's important to journal those readings and keep track of them that's never go piece I loved I do have one last question is all the hype about Mercury going retrograde really all that they make it out to be or is it just an internet scare tactic I go to work and Ethan on which astrology is that really the case here's the thing I love Mercury retrograde I love it I love it when I know Mercury is turning retrograde I get very excited you have to learn to work with it you know there's a lot of things about astrology that people throw out for clickbait for Scare Tactics there's so much of that and it's very frustrating to see it but what I thinking  I've really worked with Mercury retrograde for many years and how I tell people to work with it is when you know Mercury is getting ready to go retrograde if you're paying attention you want to know a couple weeks ahead of time and you want to sit down and you want to make a list of every single thing in your life that has been left undone that you've started but not finished and we know there's a million of those things right projects that we've started things that we started haven't gotten to make a list of those things for the three weeks that mercury is retrograde don't do anything new stick to that list go back and clean up the things on that list that Mercury retrograde. Of time will be the most powerful time to get stuff done that's great advice I love that it works so well I get so much done when Mercury is retrograde I don't start anything new but I get a lot done  Mercury going retrograde I'm going to make a list yeah do it do it make sure you pay attention when people get scared of it it's just like ya know Scare Tactics it's almost like we got to get used to it in the meantime while you're waiting for the next Mercury retrograde start something new check out this book how to read and interpret a birth chart get a little deeper into your own birth chart and I'm telling ya as someone who's not very good at this stuff just looking at my birth chart that I generated online and then going through this book helped me understand it both the book and my chart so much better so much information has intrigued me enough to make me dig a Little Deeper without too much math fright it don't be scared of the math it's really not a big deal and this is a lot of fun I'm finding a lot of fun in this but I did not  back so again thank you for that as well Lori and thank you so much for coming on the show we really appreciate it been really fun talking to both of you absolutely well I Lori Farrington.

----------------------------------------
welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire where to witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest Fells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your collagen and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode we're celebrating ostara and she'll and boy were late this year is typically in March right around the 20th right when if I ever been on time actually you're pretty darn good about being on time to be honest but this is no exception I am definitely not on time for ostara but it feels like spring now so I'm excited and you know there's lots of different reasons why you might not necessarily be able to celebrate a holiday on the holiday and a star is typically celebrated on the Spring Equinox which is usually right around March 20th and it celebrates balance and the beginning of Spring Persephone is back and her mother is excited for that really balanced on the Equinox but if you do  can I see if I remember correctly it snowed here to Spring at all but before we get into that I had an idea and I swear the last time I talked about Sacred Space so prior to going away I went to the little old PO Box I love that PO box and I love when you guys send mail it like literally makes my day you guys are awesome thank you so much for all the mail and everything you sent not only does she'll love checking the mail we love reading the mail we have some very creative very interesting very cool and witchy listeners you know some of the stuff that we've we've received has been mind-blowing but anyway back to my story I go check the mail wanted to make sure I checked it one last time before I left town and got AAA armload of things and I packed my suitcase I kind of told you I was going to bring you some  mail but I don't think you realized so I show up to Leila's house with a tubby full of mail she brought a very large plastic box all of mail from you wonderful amazing people and goodies don't forget gifts in there they're good birthday cars and goodies and candy and oh my goodness and also you finally got some of your usual gifts which for those who sent you a gift to Layla and I please know that I sent her pictures I showed her on video she did not have them until recently I feel now and I have my birthday cards and I've started going through them and in probably about a week or two will be putting up our very first male call Solari I'm so we'll be talkin about all of it so everybody who has sent mail if we have not already given you our thanks and appreciation stay tuned folks cuz the solarium is all about mail call  thank you and somebody I think the last thing that you got out of the mailbox before we left for secret space was a bunch of candy oh sweet Jesus we got some peeps and chocolate bunnies they had to be two pounds of Lindt chocolate bunnies and while they were delicious and I think and I offered you some but you said I could eat them all so here I go home so thank you Nancy so much of a Candy cell is very much enjoying it and hopefully she'll stash a little so that next time I come out I can snack on it too I will I will I know I'm not going to like it but I will kind of reminded me that I hadn't really celebrated I mean on the Equinox I thought about it a little bit you know what I had a little to you I thought about how cranky I was it was cold on the first day of spring just because the calendar told us to  it was definitely not spring so getting V osara type candy in the mail kind of reminded me that it's starting to feel like spring now especially when we were down in Maryland the weather got warm right after the snowstorm we started seeing flowers so now I'm kind of itchy I want to do some of those star things well and you know what warms my heart the other day this week I saw my first baby of the year and I also saw a bunch of robins like packing worms send an alarm to enough that yes it is spring and Asura is all about New Beginnings it's about that freshness of spraying it's all about starting new things planting those getting ready for them to ripen typically ostara is when the days and nights are of equal length this is Celestial event but our ancestors first of all didn't celebrate something  call the stara and if they did celebrate the Spring Equinox they would have done it based on gut feeling and Vibes I think trying to figure out when the days were equal they more likely would have done it when their crops started growing in the little animals started coming out and I think that at least here in America most of America cuz I actually not all of America does This Thing Called daylight savings time I have a love-hate relationship with daylight savings I really do feel you I like I like fall but I don't like that sense of my day can't technically end until well after dark I want to live like my ancestors but  you know Daylight Saving Time Savings Time kind of  gets me more in that spring mood because you know you think of spring and summer when it's lighter longer and in the days are getting longer and I think this year I don't feel like we're starting to get longer  instantly like I haven't passed years you know it's like oh you know it's March 21st all the sudden tomorrow is longer I can feel that this year you know I felt like  January to now has dragged both literally and figuratively and that's kind of how I felt about it kind of dragged well past March maybe a lot of people weren't feeling it this year because a few people mentioned online and I and a couple of our listeners asked as well you know hey I didn't celebrate on ostara for whatever reason is it okay to celebrate a few days later or in our case a couple weeks later and yes the answer is absolutely yes osara isn't just a name that Aidan Kelly gave to the WIC in celebration of the Spring Equinox it means the whole season of spring ostara is the whole spring time and if now is when you're feeling that energy if now is when you're feeling that Springtime come up and go ahead and celebrate it whether you did or didn't celebrate on the date when you're starting to see those first stirrings of spring you can celebrate ostara again or for the first time you know I also have another point to ponder and that is we've already established  published that you know I was not raised with any Hardline Christian religion but in the same respect I raised my children to celebrate the bunny and you know the season of candy and colored eggs and egg hunts with Easter not being until 4:20 it'll most makes ostara seem like it has to be later in my personal mind because of my personal mind Easter and I'm star or generally close together and it's kind of one Big Spring thing the color eggs the baskets you know I used to take my kids for pictures with the Easter Bunny I just think that this year especially with Easter being so late it kind of made ostara feel late to I have the opposite view actually I don't like when ostara and Easter are closed Easter actually was the first holiday that my children brought home from school  we always celebrated pagan holidays we celebrated the wheel of the year my kids came with me to celebrations I mean I didn't push anything I just wanted them to make their own choice when they got older and Easter Easter I think it was Kindergarten or first grade my kid comes home from school with coloring pages about Easter and wanted to know why we didn't celebrate Jesus oh yeah I know I didn't have that she learned about this in school in public school in New York state we usually celebrated ostara and the All-Star fairy you'll start a fairy would come to our house and the children get little baskets and they kick candy and usually something to plants or something to grow you know things like that we would do the eggs but after that time in school and then the next year when it happened again they really wanted to celebrate Easter and I didn't like it okay  so even now that my kids are older I like to keep them separate and we did revert back to the astara ferry only once they grow out grow their Jesus face but I still don't like it I don't even like to color eggs I do like to have eggs in my wrists are things but coloring them feels to eastery to me and so I don't like the co-opting of my religion and I really didn't like it in public school I totally got that and I'm not looking to defend the New York State Department of Education my kids are so went to obviously a different Publix and it usually was about bunnies and eggs and duckies and you know they do really come home with like a styrofoam cup that had something planted in it but you knew me back then when my kids were that age you knew I would have flip shit if that's actually I caused the scene at the school  you know I ain't right and that particular teacher understood what had happened the second year it was other students it was other kids kind of pressuring and it wasn't the actual teacher and hand out yes it was why don't you celebrate Easter where is your Easter basket what do you mean you don't know who Jesus is like when I was in seventh grade and want to go to CCD cuz that's what all my friends did after school one day a week bible study thing I don't know somebody can give a better explanation than I but it's like a religious studies and all my friends my friends and then when I realized what it was I was like okay I'll see you tomorrow it can be hard I mean when the mainstream religion is not yours it can be very difficult especially for children but that can also be a source of strength  saying a lot of the overlap is joyful to some people they can easily celebrate because you can find Easter / ostara / spring things everywhere and so that can bring a lot of safety and comfort and joy to people because of the overlap and for some reason I don't know why it was ingrained in me as a young child but there's something about Easter I feel like it has to involve hats pretty dresses and white shoes play my grandmother until you mentioned it I completely forgot that we hadn't already passed Easter and I was going to talk about how happy I was that Easter was already over and I didn't have to worry about it in my ostara I take pleasure in the fact that this year Easter's on 4/20 so I know you're going to be celebrating that's hilarious I did okay will be having a party on Easter and they'll be a lot of greenery there let's just the memes  Facebook related to that arapik I'm just saying so although I did kind of poopoo on Easter later I do have a set of star a spell that involves an egg shell so there's a little bit of crossover I'm okay with no I want to just for a minute let's talk about the people who think we're crazy that's probably a lot what are your thoughts and it how do you combat people who say what the hell are you guys doing talking about him celebrating ostara I do me and here we are but like how would you combat someone who thinks we're kind of nuts okuku know I wouldn't say that if you want to celebrate the moment of the Equinox that's great but like a full moon think of a full moon you can celebrate it before or after the actual Celestial moment of the full moon  wheel of the Year events are way bigger than that so I feel like you can celebrate ostara throughout the entire spring season on our once honor it twice every single day if you want to and do it whenever you would like at the beginning of the episode we were talking about how now we're starting to really feel Spring & C spring and I can do some of the things that say spring to me like planting seeds and working on my land and you know going out and cleaning up my outdoor altars those only just recently were possible so that's what I would say is I'm celebrating the season as it appears where I'm at you know I have the same to you but I kind of simplify it down to the Equinox is a moment where is ostara is a season beautiful I know what I mean randomly I do every so often not every single year on the equinox  phone with my dad might be like a week later I mean and standard sometimes we celebrate had a ritual on a Wednesday after work and Community celebrate the Sabbath on the closest weekend to the Sabbath on a Tuesday night was 2 weeks away which I have to say I'm very excited our former Pagan Community gathering together for Beltane this year so I'm super stoked about that I'm really actually going to try because I felt when I found out I felt yes I went two years ago there wasn't one last year I'm thinking this might be the Rumblings of trying to get back together or get the band back together man  the wonderfulness of that group and getting the band back together the world is Shifting back to a sense of community in unity we do need each other especially now especially with all the tax on paganism on anybody who's different we need to stand together but we need to get together and community community is wonderful. So usually I'm spread lady do not  stop yourself please resay that line so I don't put it in the way it just sounded tarot spread lady  I kind of like spread lady myself all right I'm leaving it in then it's okay I will indeed I have signed both our faith so you said that you have the tarot spread I want to hear it the listeners want to hear it what is your spring to spread so I was kind of bumming around on the internet the other day I was supposed to be doing emails and it said I was going down internet rabbit holes and I came across a couple people on Reddit talking about you would read it I know I love rabbit hay shout out to the read it back on the rim stickers love you guys if you're going to jump in the Reddit are Reddit group is a good one it's small but it's very good the witches on their amazing I pop in once in a while I was in right on read it and I saw a couple people mentioned that they hadn't celebrated ostara and they were wanting to and that got me thinking about how you and I haven't  talking about celebrating ostara late and then bumped into a very old on Tumblr if you can believe that tarot reading it's called the seed sounds fitting right and specifically for ostara it's by someone called tarot dreams taradash dreams on Tumblr and the seed has 5 cards and I'll put up a picture on all of our socials but it's basically two cards in like Saginaw 12 diagonally and then in another diagonal line just to the right of that 345 going down so to diagonal lines interesting pattern the first card you put down one and two the first card is the soil where have you grown the soil is your past where do you grow from what do you grow from and what lessons can be learned from the past is the weed and you want to  grow and be strong but there's something that stunt in your progress what are your obstacles and what's holding you back like that so then the first number three and that's a seed and in your immediate future what area of your life will you first start to see signs of growth what seeds have taken hold number for is the Sun and that's love and support from other people but the will to grow comes from within the sun is a reminder of what you need to keep in mind in order to help yourself grow so energy from other people that you internalize and a kind of used to grow and then number five the last card is the rain this is a blessing in disguise and it asks you to understand that things are not always as they seem sometimes when the skies are gray you might feel sad or depressed but rain is just as necessary as the sun  so what blessing in disguise Is On Your Horizon I love that spray either too of course I tried it out as soon as I saw and I absolutely love it this is a fantastic so I will definitely post that and all the different positions and meanings on our socials and on the website I usually put them in the block so if you're looking on their website or things I say in the pocket that usually in the block area so Springtime in Salem we very often say is one of our favorite times and Salem I know but I've got I've got something that I don't think the listeners are ready for what do you mean so you know how during the spring time you know one spring is officially sprung Home Depot goes crazy okay that's true all the different garden stores and everybody absolutely Home Depot turns into like the mecca okay and I found myself at Home Depot and I'm glad you're sitting down  because I wouldn't want you to fall and pass out and get hurt by this but I bought 3 more plants that I'm going to try to keep alive you did what do you even want to I didn't think you would like to taking care of the two I gave you  I didn't mean no as an answer to your question but loosen like I've had this weird like I've had a change of heart or an epiphany or I don't know what it is or if I just feel like I need to spite everybody and prove a point that could be it too cuz you know how I am I want to do this and you've known this that you know every year I do plant a little herb garden and it doesn't do too bad because the outside is controlling everything got me so I didn't plan to go get seeds which I got I got my seeds but I walked out with three plans and then I was searching for what do you call those things you put them in pots those things like I found two gorgeous ones I was having fun at Home Depot but I did buy things that I don't know what they are I'm not going to lie to you folks  cashier did tell me that they were for the inside and the outside I think I can do this folks I have faith in you and here here's why I'm starting to think I could do this what is that plant you gave me that has the heart shape a heart leaf philodendron that thing is like all of a sudden there shoots coming out I put it in a window near son who knew who freaking meal so it's like the chutes are coming out in the leaves are like these deep green leaves and I'm like oh my God and then first of all I put it in a place where the cats can't bite it fantastic into new shoots now that haven't been bitten by cats so you're feeling to grow things bug and you went out and got three more no I haven't told you the biggest part of that she want you to remember the mushroom Fiasco yes mushrooms were growing in the plant  in some of our listeners bless their souls they were so patient with me we're giving me different reasons on why they thought that these mushrooms could be randomly appearing in these plants and somebody said more actually more than one person said this that I should take them out of the dirt and put them in nude like I know what that means so I cut them out of what they were and I just shut them a little bit and I peeled off very gently without hurting any Roots peeled off a lot of the dirt not all of it cuz you know I can only do so much I'm a plant killer hear people and I put them in new dirt that's wonderful I'm so glad and it's been 5 days they didn't die because of it was practically an expert I love it I just think I could do this I think you might have this I don't have to post pictures because no one is going to believe this right now now and three new ones I'm impressed  any pictures I want to see I'm going to have to send them to you because I don't know what the hell I bought except for the lady that was the cashier said there for the house while I will help you out I did confirm with her also that the if the Caps tried to eat a my cats would not die perfect pull out house plant Horticulture and we'll have a little plants fashion will take a look that sounds like a perfect thing to do to celebrate ostara people please send me and the plants your blessings we need everything we can get right now that's actually my favorite thing to do this time of year everybody knows so I am in the middle of repotting all my plants yeah but it's normal for you that's very true and we set up a little station outside on my front patio and I very much like when I'm doing see when I'm putting the dirt in the cops or in a new pot I like to just fill it up a little bit and then draw schedule in the dirt or maybe put a little tiny bit of  eggshell that I have put a little spell on or if I make up a little herbs not an incense cuz I wouldn't burn it but if I mix a little herbs a little crushed eggshells and put some intentions in there for prosperity to grow to grow Serenity whatever I want to grow and put it at the bottom not enough that it's really going to affect the plant but enough to set my intentions with the growing thing then as it grows that can of carries that intention up so I'll do that when I'm reporting my plans and start a new season and it just really gotten me into the ostara mindset herbs I have a conversation with them and I'm like oh please just gross and you know I've actually been pretty successful at the whole 2 years but I don't know it's a big step with these plants I'll keep you updated so you can do all of those things honey there's all sorts of lovely cooking things that are great for us  have fruit with honey just things that make you think about outdoors and freshness and newness open a window open a window and set your intention when you do it so think about all the things in your in your house all this stagnation you know think about the winter and everything is kind of just been sitting there that you want to get rid of and then as you open the window switch that energy out and ask your land Spirits your ancestors the energies of the universe to take all that negativity all that stuffing is out the window and replace it with fresh spring new and that's just a little mini spell you can do right there spring cleaning isn't just for the house it's for your soul to you and I do have a spell I was thinking about how I'm not a huge decorate eggs fans will do eastery for me but I love eggs as a symbol I think there are fantastic symbol for ostara and for spring you know that the new bunnies are being born  not eggs I know but babies are being born eggs breakfast eggs shells and protection spells because the shell itself is protecting new life right it's keeping it safe while it grows so I think that is a fantastic item to use if you're going to be making black salt you can use instead of the salt if you're going to be putting it outside but it's a great protection ingredient so I thought wouldn't it be great to do like an ostara egg thing as a spell have you ever taken an egg in poke holes in the top and bottom kind of blow it out and keep the eggshell intact my mother was a craft of course I have blown eggs  this spell requires that so you put one little pin hole and one slightly bigger hole on the other end of your eggs but not too big not too big no but you definitely wanted to be big enough that you can easily put like a rolled-up slip of paper and some seeds and herbs into it so small but not too small and you let all the insides out make yourself some scrambled eggs and bread whatever you want to do with it now you have a vessel basically you have a jar to put your spell in so you take a little wax and seal up the small pin hole and then in the larger you're going to put your spell ingredients so the idea is to set your intentions for a spell reason she'll make a Prosperity spring ostara spell in this shell so as you were cleaning out the egg you think of all the negativity going away think of starting new think of starting fresh and clean and then  have your eggshell take either a bay leaf or a little piece of bark or a small piece of paper and on it right prosperities money comes to me easily write I am inspired and work hard whatever it is that you need for Prosperity write that down then take some herbs flowers seeds anything natural that corresponds to your goal the green-eyed make a little green paper right right dollar signs on paper for abundance maybe I put mint calendula maybe some basil and for the seed sunflower seeds are great for attracting success and poppy seeds are also good for that carrot seeds are really good for grounding and for supporting long-term goals so you can put some of those seeds in the shell pick up a whole are you putting in this thing you're thinking of the teeny tiny holes that are put into eggshells by Crafters we're putting a teeny tiny hole on one end and a kind of bigger hole on the other  so not too big but big enough to put things in this is intended to be a jar and so it doesn't matter if one hole is a little bit bigger we're going to cap it later anyway so grind up your herbs roll up the paper real small and tight and put it in that little hole and just drop in one or two seat so trust me they'll fit everything in your shell you can steal both holes with wax or you don't have to if you don't want to hold it in your hands and push your intention for Success think of all the things that you have gained all the success that you have think of it as an if you have it right now and push it all into that egg and put the egg on your alter and let it sit there for a couple days and every time you see it think of abundance think of success think of money and prosperity and all those things coming to get your teacher I have a Twist can I tell you a Twist I would love to hear twist go for it okay you're going to hate me because it's it's it's mixed in that damn Easter thing so okay  like I said crap after we had to blow a eggs and the reason we would do that and what would be a perfect thing for this is so I follow you up until you seal your egg okay so you seal it with wax on both ends and then what I would do is a kid and what my mother would have us do is we would take a white crayon and we would draw things on the egg now obviously can't see it cuz it's in white cran so you can put your sigils any symbols or whatever but then what we would do Flipping it back to Easter is done we would dip them in and done anything that I wrote in with the white crayon came out as white and didn't get done that way not only can you put all of your things inside the egg but you can put sigils on the outside as well and you can do that either before you put the things in it just let it dry first or after  you don't have to color it I just had to add that inks I love colored eggs I think you have to now it fits perfectly for adding that in there so you have to so after you leave your beautifully decorated inside and out egg on your altar for a little while three days is traditional but 9 days 5 days whatever works for you when you're ready to release the power of that spell take the egg concentrate on your goals and concentrate on that energy and then take it to an outdoor space someplace that's okay for a little bit of organic litter maybe your backyard something like that and then concentrate really hard pull all that energy up from the ground from the universe from the sky and push it into that egg you're going to throw the egg and as you pull your arm back almost thinking it like you're pulling back the string of a bow like a card draw that energy back with the egg in your hand and then throw it as hard as you can. It's somebody not if somebody  not if somebody not even if it's to get the fuck away from me spell preferably don't throw two people but throw it like at a tree or in the ground or in a rock as you let it leave your hand let the kinetic energy of your body add to the magical energy that you're pushing into it and feel that energy push the egg out of your hand and then as it smashes against whatever you've thrown it again that releases all the spelling ingredients all the energy that you have pushed into it from the time you created it until you filled it with all that energy and through it and now releases it out to the universe for your spell to do its work make sure everything in it is organic and biodegradable and then go ahead and throw that shit absolutely die I think that's fantastic you know sometimes crafts are made to break when I make cakes and I would make a labret amazing cakes and people be like it's too pretty to eat know the point is to eat it  stop Chop Chop that's right in this case the point is to fill it with things and decorate it and the point is to break it so that I can work I love that so eggs are great as a container jar for spells but in this particular case it's designed only to be held for a short period of time while it absorbs energy and then to be shattered to release that energy to do its work sometimes using an actual physical representation of energy in this case kinetic Force physical energy of a throw that's energy that can be useful in a spell so that can help you visualize the energy because you're actually doing physical energy to add to the spell work so that I can help sometimes if you're not able to maybe feel psychic energy or magical energy as well as you are literally putting it out there literally throwing it with kinetic energy of your body hurling it through space on its own it magically flies by itself so that's how is right there you can even if you want to I know some people like to after a spell  is Donnie like to see how their candles burnt or how their incense burned in and kind of do Conjuring or do divination from that so once the spell has shattered you can go and see what kind of patterns is broken into like a Tea Leaf reading if you want to and you can do a little divination from that and give you an idea of the direction to spell might be going in if you throw really far and hard can't do that that's just like a bird hatching like I love to watch The Big Bear bald eagles live in California I watch them on YouTube two little babies you literally made me watch that when I was at your house not too long ago and this year they have two little chicks who little baby eaglets but just like a a bird hatches from an egg that's that kinetic energy that potential energy new life is springing from this shattering egg that's the same as your spell this this new beginnings this new life comes from this breaking of the egg  so there you go there's a spouse now we've got a spell that you can do for a star as well or for your Springtime well after this chat I don't feel so bad that I wasn't in the groove of a restaurant in March I hope others feel the same that even if you're not feeling it on the calendar date that doesn't mean I'll let you know I was busy or not feeling well or had other plans or wasn't into it on March 21st I guess I just am not going to celebrate it absolutely not do that and even if it's something as simple as doing a craft or lighting a candle and saying thank you for the season if you're repotting your houseplants it's okay to just acknowledge the season add a little bit of extra energy to something you're already doing and call it that's all right you're still awake you're still honoring the season you're still working magic it doesn't always have to be elaborate small acts of magic are sometimes the most powerful and it might my last part  Scott is 12 our listeners please add my plants to your prayer list I'm going to give it my best effort but they're going to need all the love and support you can give them I think they're going to be great you've done really well all things considered your cats being plant murderers hey I've still kept that sings someone to live life been like 6 months so I think if you kept those two alive I think you're ready for these I think he got this show I have faith in you.

Come with a box or a book but it came with a handmade bag and I absolutely love it and I also got the Celtic Tree Oracle that was a good fine she got all the things that I already looked at  I went through those tarot decks I've had free rein but the books the books I was able to get anything I wanted you did find me a great book there at the The Witches Bible complete by Janet and Stuart Broad Ripple to buy some used things was really nice but I think we're glossing over the most synchronistic thing that we saw sitting right on Joe's table when we moved like mind-blowing so and it will get into the deities to invoke for this ritual had this all planned out and we kind of thought we could be chosen a less common goddess I guess it's the best way to say it so we walk in to Joe and his table of wonderful goods and what the hell do we see the statue  who would have thought  now before we went shell had managed to get a statue of each of the deities that we were going to be invoking for the spiritual so you already had another one of the ways I snatched her up so fast and then I would be remiss if I did not mention this so Layla gets this Ellen statue does happen we immediately go up to our room to put it safe and sound on the altar that we'd set up the table in our room I reach over to make my tea and my sleeve knocked over Ellen two pieces pieces thankfully it was a very small piece literally just her sleeve knocked off and you couldn't even tell and less you knew that they had come off that there was a problem include right back on new I know but I felt like  you were very sweet about it but no our little Alan so we actually put a picture of the two islands in candles as we were getting ready to set up our ritual on on the social media to check it out back on the broomstick on Instagram and Facebook. Start off with day one day one I'm going to say is are driving so tell the people how we left what was the weather like when we left a literal snowstorm literal snowstorm I was a little concerned that the snow wasn't going to stop before we left but thankfully it did it we're going to fast forward like five days the day we left Maryland it was a weird day before the conference started a temporary room we did we did this is a Story 2  and then it's time for the opening ritual there's like 18 different rooms that they do activities and workshops in this one particular room which will be important is our story goes this room will be important later on and that was a good ritual the opening ritual one of the things that Sacred Space does is the board of Sacred Space goes in ahead of time and kind of sets Wars and sets space and call what they call the egregore of Sacred Space so the entity that they have kind of created over doing this for so many years and so at the opening ceremony they call upon the spirits of Sacred Space and they also call upon the idea of hospitality they call upon the rules of hospitality and they basically Encompass the entire Hotel the whole place in Sacred Space which you know I love them  because they create the second one Ballroom so there was a lot of people a lot of energy the minute that ritual was done it was like it was a thing that did carry on and you could feel throughout the weekend even if you weren't doing the ritual or even if you weren't in a workshop if you were just sitting in the lobby station on a muffin and tea you could feel that energy and it made Community very easy it was easy to talk to people even for someone like me who is very shy and anti-social it was very easy you could feel the camaraderie and the energy between people with really nice but I love that you mentioned the opening ceremony because that ritual was held in the same room now the big big Ballroom was split  the three separate room three very large separate rooms and we had requested one of those for our ritual because we're making a large spiral like a Fibonacci ask spiral out of candles and we needed the space interesting Lee the room that we were chosen to do that ritual in also happened to be the room where the opening ceremony was done and our ritual would be done just a few hours later after the dinner break and so the energy was very much present and still there when we went in to set up and at that was very cool no let's talk about this so next on our agenda for the week is Sacred Space was our ritual after the dinner break so there was the opening ceremony there was one Workshop well there was several workshops in a time once upon a time slot  we've done this a thousand times and it's nerve-wracking each and every time and we had just left our temporary room and we had to wait until 4 which was a few hours before our ritual started at 7:30 to check into our new room and of course they were very busy because it was a very large conference I mean everybody there was so nice everybody that works there is amazing but they at the front desk people were great and they were very helpful we went back to them several times cuz they kept telling us to come back but we were nice they were nice and like she'll said they didn't have our room ready on time and they gave us an upgrade to like the top floor  and it had is all somehow she was so cute I can't remember her name but she was so sweet she's like well your room's not ready but I found one that is and we're just going to give you a little bit of an upgrade girl she hooked us up so good I wish I knew her gift card only entry Club room that had 24/7 snacks drinks whatever you wanted and free breakfast I mean how I felt the whole weekend what we kind of where we were so we had an amazing room and man we met so many people I met dinner break I think we talked to like four or five different people before you even ask but you know I think we didn't realize it at the time but the significance of us being in that room was just Cosmic it was just one  it was one coincidence synchronicity wonderful thing that happened after another and our ritual being in the same room as the opening ritual it had so many layers and as we go through this episode we're going to talk about all the other rituals that happened in that room that seem to each a Coweta other and they kept calling back to each other we said some of the same phrase that weren't typical phrases used here we invoke some of the same energies it was very very interesting the synchronicities that kept popping up and the layer upon layer of magic in that room but first we'll talk about our ritual we really had a good time putting us together and I think that the hardest part in retrospect I don't think people understand what it's like to have to turn on and lay down like 250 camp  still sore from turning candles on if you do get to see the picture of the two Allen of the ways of statues that we have on social media you'll see that they're surrounded by cups filled with electronic candles candles on and then we laid them out and if you've never seen 249 candles laid out a sweet out in the spiral check out her social media is kind of pretty so yeah that was the hardest part we set up to beautiful Alters actually shell did that I made a few finishing touches but other than that it was all you gorgeous. They have are Ellen of the ways we had Care New knows which are two deities that we both love working with and it was really really nice even though one of the Ellen Show with broken she didn't mind I don't mind it's all right she fixed up good so what we did was we had people come in and we talked about the fool and the fools past being  I have a spiral like the Fibonacci spiral that connects everything the golden ratio and we got into a little math nerd is going to show you how about that the fool is with us on this journey on our path that we are the fool and that this path isn't just a straight line it's more of a spiral or occurred and it connects all of us and that you can be at multiple different places on this path at once you can be anywhere on this path and that you should always reconnect with that part of yourself that isn't afraid to take chances to take leaves whether you're at the beginning of the end and in addition to that we were going to be walking the spiral of candles to emphasize walking with the fool in the spiral of life and we decided to call to deities that were also path Walker sometimes you worry about time in these things  under the bus right here now so I know what that we had some listeners there shotshell out in a minute so I realized this unless you happen to see the look I gave Layla at that particular moment we got into a point where we talked about the whole point of what we are doing and then we decide to it to circle the whole kit and caboodle beforehand like I have this  detailed sing written out like she knew how long it was we had a back-and-forth call you would call Ellen I just went out okay when last we left our Intrepid witches we were on the precipice was a fool waiting to see how much you cut me off all right yes I did I cut off I cut off our DD call so it's so talk to me a little bit about it the deities and and your DD call and then go ahead and tell the people that I totally messed you up and I'll I'll say well it wasn't that you're totally messed me up other than I really felt that the best things I was going to say was at the very end but it wasn't that you messed me up it just in this is where you when I Vibe very well like it caught me off-guard like it's almost like if you trip over something but you don't follow you like tripping catch yourself and then keep going like I caught myself  I was like what the hell is she doing I'm not done yet it's a good point and afterwards we talked about that and I was super impressed with our our energy together in circle was like right there even though we haven't really done major rituals together and how many years what you're saying is we communicate without communicating  for the Richmond we have decided to call Karen Olson Ellen of the ways as we said because their path Walker's there in that liminal space and and we were going to kind of be in that time out of time and space out of space for this particular working we wanted those types of DNA's so shall was calling elen of the ways and I was calling care nuno's and we have these beautiful calls right now and we have been seriously working on them right up to the day before and had a back-and-forth kind of call going it was really really great and it wasn't what happened it was but you know you just you just you just like I said it's like tripping and you just kind of catch yourself we started out the workshop describing what we were doing and then we can circle with a heart-to-heart circle cast that we used to do in our old Community which by the way I was a little more than we had expected so the circle cast take a little longer than I expected it's very nice to take the hand of the person to your left and you hold it to your heart and you say from my heart and then you put your hands  over their heart and say to your heart we cast a circle and then you do that around the entire circle is a very beautiful way to connect everyone in the castle but it does take a little bit of time then after that she invoked energies into we didn't exactly call quarters but she'll did a beautiful little car where she invoked the energy so I didn't want to be like in but it's in my circle we got to call everything yeah I didn't want to call quarters but I did want to make sure that it was included definitely we couldn't call a circle without having the elements they're just not in a wicked way the Guardians of the West back and forth invocations on a Shelf  Alan and myself calling caring and we got about half way and I did and I did and the reason why is because I could feel the energy these are kind of long and yeah but they were a little long and we hadn't again anticipated quite so many people so we didn't think that those Circle casting would take so long I just felt like people had been standing around I could feel the energy in a circle shift and I didn't want to lose our participants I wanted to kind of keep the energy slowly building until we moved into the candlelit Fibonacci spiral walk and then the meditation I didn't want to lose people and I could feel it slipping and so rather than keep going with you admittedly very gorgeous Vianney invocation I kind of gave shell the silent City immediately picked up on and we both without saying A word without any type of outward sign immediately moved on to the next part to get  and that even though we didn't get to say bakul calls that was beautiful that was beautiful magic but actually the next part was my most favorite part so you had made these beautiful beautiful cards which Bravo by the way an overlay so they all look the same of you know the number zero and the floor jacks with the four and you know what is my most favorite thing doing these things having anyway so you gave everyone a card and then I left the whole group in a walk around this Fibonacci spiral of beautiful candles lit in this gorgeous Ballroom it was beautiful as absolute  will definitely put up more pictures of that for sure we did this beautiful spiral walk shell him on this amazing shirt and I'll put a link to the chant and we were placed a word lady with fool so full of the labyrinth we chanted as we went around it was really cool I think that is where we were able to pick back the energy up and kind of get it back into a flow and there was something about walking there a spiral maybe it was because I was first having everyone behind me chanting that I don't know what that was all about it it was free with beautiful sofa Fibonacci spiral at into a Center Circle we had everyone sit down in the circle and we did it a really cool meditation to meet the Fool on the spiral because we talked about life not being a straight path it's not linear And The Fool is not just the beginning it's also the end so there's a cycle there so we went through the spiral Matt the fool learn some lessons and then came  stopping and retrace our steps what is a very cool ritual but my next favorite part was right before we retreated back through the spiral we gave participants the option to either keep their full card you know stay on their current path or exchange it for an Infiniti card which were actually the same Prints but instead of the zero they had the Infinity on them and I feel like it was almost split between people who kept their card and people who picked up a Infiniti card in exchange kept their card was slightly more than 50% I think there was really close guess of the Infiniti card was very popular and then at the end some people did, and request extras to take home with them which again take away their cool when we had to have one and it was wonderful but the coolest part of this ritual was how it echoed and reverberated throughout the entire week  synchronicities would like how many times did we look at each other in a one or two a day throughout the entire several days and it seems like from the opening ritual than ours was second to hack at a ritual that night the themes of being on the spiral walking belt on each other the idea of be here now everyone kept saying some of these same phrases transformation liminal spaces cat would expect to hear some of those types of an idea as you don't disturb this was definitely not coincidence it was beautiful to see the magic layering like that just day after day and of course you know being followed  almost immediately by Lera Tempest is a cross doing the crossroads Christopher Christopher and Mara again in the exact same place we had ulcers in the same places and and it was just you know I didn't realize but because I am who I am I felt the irony of one you know so so they opening ritual they had they had their thing that they did but then our ritual the second actual I invoked Ellen of the ways and then the rich will immediately following the info Tecate on what's going on here  so much good stuff but yeah this Sacred Space definitely opened those doors we were definitely standing at the crossroads and learning there and learning so much in that in the beginning they create a Sacred Space for Sacred Space and truly they meet that goal and then you can feel it as you walk around and the interesting thing for me is I loved all the workshops this year and again I had trouble picking which ones to go to in the same spot but last year I felt like it was all happiness and joy and light and I love meeting people and this year there was a ton of that but it also felt very I had a lot of work to do it was very it was very good but I felt myself and I'm still doing it I'm still there's a lot of Shadow work at seem to uncover a lot of deep things I've needed to like journal and work  and that's been pretty amazing but talked to she was a little different you know if I had if I had to put it in my shell way I'd say last year they were fun shops in this year they were literally workshops so heavy original was kind of putting people's feet on the path and say it really did you know we kind of put them there like it's going to be okay if you're back in the dog you're going to be all right in two hours ago and she's going to kick your ass so grab that pack I thought you were okay when I'm a cauldron of transformation that's what I call my coffee in the morning  so yes the Workshops the people and oh my gosh the people I cannot even count how many listeners that we met our star and Val and Holly and live oh my gosh so many people you know so Cassie Cassie I love you but for some strange reason I just want to call you a cat and I wanted to call you cat the whole Sacred Space and I still want to call you a cab but I understand it's Kathy but I'm just going to call you and don't forget Amy and Amy Amy and Amy we met them last year and oh my God so you know week we connected with some of our old Workshop friends some of our old presenter friends and then we connected with new presenter friends it was definitely a time for you know what felt very much like a intentional Community Building almost like there's a lot of work to do and none of us can do it alone so here we are  like a community-building 100% yes I absolutely felt that too I felt like we either we need each other especially now we definitely need to be here together we all need to be a part of the collective yeah that's kind of the whole thing pulled together for me is kind of like it takes a Village People funny that you say that because that's one of the biggest takeaways that I came with it I'm going to this very small uu church that's not too far from me that has a a little cake and commuting I'm going to try and work with them you know when I get home you know bring a smaller and spread that I want to spread the information that we learned to the people in my community so I'm very much looking forward to starting like a once-a-month roof at this little uu church but I think a lot of people felt that that building that Community taking the energy that we all kind of bills up there and spread that out into our local communities when we all go home and kind of bring that energy back with us because we  really need that now let's just quick touch on the variety of things that we we were able to experience Workshop wise what's your favorite I was going to make you pick a favorite child oh gosh I will I really like the last one we went to was Christians and that was the Alpine witchery and we are going to have Christian on our show but I loved his because the history was fascinating yeah I don't want to give anything away right now but you are going to want to catch the episode of Christian because it was eye-opening to me some of the things that that he has to chat about I adore folk Magic from all over and I like seeing the similarities and the differences and so if that was cool I also like Ness Bosch you know me and bonez & Ness is a bone floods in Magic which very very cool.  Talkington us as well so we got to talk about ink magic tattoo magic and she's got a great book so that was nice I really honestly surprisingly I had a lot of fun okay not surprisingly I love Matt are and he's amazing absolutely phenomenal psychic tarot dude you know I was taking a bath in that was a great Workshop in that was top two or three yeah I was definitely in the top his workshop on the second part of Tara was really really good yeah I got to take a shop but let's talk about my fan-girl moment when I saw Christopher Hughes for the first time okay well yeah that the cerridwen ritual was definitely right up in the top it was amazingly well done he did an awesome job and keeping an entire room of 200 people hundred  after the energy going and you could feel the energy moving around when he was working the energy working the circle and honestly I had a funny moment because we're not going to talk about the time I forgot how to stay my freaking name that was funny but in a past episode we were talking about alter tools and ritual tools I talked about a boat which is at a sickle looking guy that's like a crescent moon looking knife and I mention it only ever seen one and use once until now had a very gorgeous very large believe that he used as an athame in the ritual and that was very very cool and not just because it was him it was phenomenal absolutely and Laura Tempest eckroth did the Lord that was fabulous that was  you know if you can get again almost 200 people to sit silent at the end of this gorgeous ritual where she embodied Hecate and the crossroads in the room and allowed people to come to her and circle and receive a blessing from Picante that we took what like half an hour 20 minutes half an hour the rest of us sat and held space silently for half an hour silently in this room in this account a ritual we just sat there and held that energy and it was freaking cool it was yeah yeah it's amazing but yeah sorry what was your favorite I actually would have to say that Christians with my favorite I'm so glad you said that you know he he's just I think what he has to talk about it like I said I don't want to give too much away cuz we are going to interview them soon but just very interesting very interesting history very interesting information  and you know I didn't necessarily know that Austria had its own folklore Traditions so I opening my really I really don't decide as always I absolutely fabulous amazing don't tell them anything know I was going to say I would have to say that her workshops are always my top favorite workshops speak for yourself she leaves The Sisterhood Of Avalon which I totally dig so she never puts on a bad Workshop very information packed you know she's just a good presenter I just I like what she presents every time I see her after one of her workshops that we went to we've been talking to her also about coming on the show so we went up to say hello and  I thought you were going to tell him I'm going to tell him I have to explain why I can't ever talk to her again she will never ever be on the show is because I then proceeded to hug this woman now Jenna and I are close to the same fight that I've got nothing if you can believe that gorgeous woman holy cow and she has the most beautiful head of black curly hair I hug her and put my arm around her and I'm wearing this very cool beaded a spiral bracelet it's wire and it has a hook on the end and that freaking hook caught in her hair so badly in the first few seconds it was like that bracelet fell in love with her hair and never wanted to come out again I almost started crying Isaac Michelle please come help me but I had the pleasure of digging your bracelet out of Jenna's hair cuz you hugged her that was pretty Tangled and took me a few minutes I never wanted to let her go  so as much as you were mortified by getting tangled in her hair I appreciate the fact that you gave me the opportunity to touch her hair so we can never talk to her again we will never ever I just can't do it okay that's not true we did see her several times after that and she thinks that was not our only fun and interesting moment with one of the more famous of our fellow pagans that were there and we did get a chance to talk to Christopher Hughes and bring some books to have signed by having you have to bring this up because you are now famous amongst Christopher and his friends and you need to tell why you do first of all the fact that he's going to remember me for this Google you're going to be the American who introduced him to his next book title so the story here folks is Once Upon a Time  I don't know a year ago or so and I decided we were going to get Christopher hughes's book cauldron-born so fabulous so this book arrives at my home and my sweet darling love sees this book and I don't know if it's age or silliness but he thought it was called cauldron-born it's in like an old English font it kind of looks like so then you don't go back and go back to my coven people and I'm like a coven people isn't this hysterical he calls it covered porch so no makeup and like totally calls it cauldron-born so they got the coven call in at cauldron-born we call it cauldron pouring here at home you and I now call it cauldron-born so silly old me decides in My Fit of fangirling and losing my brain where is you forgot your name I forgot all sensibility and I tell her  Super Shoes the story about how we call his book cauldron-born we call it cauldron porn he's loved it. It was hysterical to which I found out the next morning because I actually had to mention it to him again the next morning he ended up texting his friends back in Wales and said that he knew what his new book title is going to be cauldron-born so-called gets published and you are welcome hopefully she'll get some royalties from it because we're running low on tea folks  so yes we definitely kept our entire weekend and oh my gosh just had such a great time and I do want to mention a couple of our listeners are one we did have a birthday girl was there it was very fun she came all the way from California and we got to sing Happy Birthday to her so that was very cool thank you so much for taking such a long trip to come out I also wanted to mention this one young woman who and Matt Ahrens Workshop he handed out cards to everyone shell and I both managed to get nights I got the name of Pentacles and you got the Knight of Swords swords and the fool was right in front of us which I thought was fun but when I turned around to see the young person behind me there's a person with the card behind me if caught my eye and I immediately knew I had to read for them and so I asked if I could and she just happened to be a listener who is a tattoo artist  so I wanted to mention her very quickly give a shout out to re star and I'll put some information some links down to her tattoo shop because she's local to Towson and her tattoos are gorgeous she showed us a picture of one she had just done like a chest piece with a crow skull and wings was very very gorgeous we did it last year we should do it next year may absolutely if you ever get a chance to go either online or in-person to workshop with Maura Starling not only is she hysterical but so freaking knowledgeable she just presents information you're laughing your learning you're having such a good time and at the end of it you feel like she's your best friend and you just want to go hang out you know I think I felt that way with everybody there to be honest whether it was friends or  are are present her friends I mean we just  it was it was just it was a good time everybody have a good time and we were all just kind of happy and chatty and I love that about festivals as it is easier I'm an introvert I am so shy and I we did that was fun. Hopefully this listener will be going to Brushwood folklore Center this year as well so that will be looking for her is coming up pretty quickly and bring about a couple of festivals that we are hoping to prevent that, the entire time we were there is in the morning we would draw schedule for the day and then at night we would draw some cards and kind of get an overview of the Lessons Learned for that day you know I think we were really good in the beginning and then we kind of got a little off-kilter towards the end but I think it was because  it just got deeper and deeper as the week went on it really dead and we kept saying I mean we were up early in the morning going down to work shops and things first thing in the morning and then staying up late late at night you know all the things going on so it was it was difficult but I did like that I did like having the I-10 to do sigils a lot especially when I'm out and doing what she thinks because it helps to keep me focused for the day you know if I do a word or phrase information talk and then around the triangle Weezer the alphabet and then pick the word for the day and then what was it we circled the first letter and then drew a line to the second drew a line to the third and so on and then but what a slash on the last letter and then made a composite of that on a new piece of paper and kind of  so we chose a triangle shape you know that the three sides of the Delta all of that was in with a good symbol and that you separate the alphabet right a third of it on one arm turn on the next in the third on the last write out your word or phrase eliminate any duplicate letters you only want each letter to appear once and then exactly what she'll said you Circle the first letter draw your line to each letter keep going in and the last letter you put a slash through it it makes me little symbol most of the time I think we used to Triangle I did use a circle once and I think I used to square one so you can do any any shape that you want there's all sorts of different ways to do sigils and we'll get we'll get more in-depth than that in another episode what they're really great or festivals if I'm at a conference it really helps to helps me to focus for the day to have like a phrase or assemble it so that I can look at to help keep me on track and I think with the the card pulls at night I think we did anywhere between like 3 and 5 Card polls  yeah and that was nice especially to do data shared by the second night shall had bought several decks choices so we have choices we both brought several decks with us I did get the feed Cheryl signed by Christopher Hughes which made me very happy even though he said that you'll tear off his favorite by Christopher Hughes before anyone else gets it but it was really nice to be able to you know kind of decide what we wanted. Cards and then talk about a little bit I just a different track every time and that was kind of nice being able to do that yeah  we had a little magic going on and as usual we set up an altar in our room we do like to set up our way Alters this time I got to be a little elaborate because we did bring extra since we were setting them up for the restore it was more like an old turntable alright people have their little pocket altars in the Altoid tins and shells bought a tubby exclusively for travel Alters that's true that's true I was more referring to the one on wheels that you purchase specifically to carry things in well yeah next year I am very much looking forward to going to their conference it is going it's called Sacred Space in between the worlds in between the worlds it does there own festival and I guess I think it's every 3 or 5 years they combined so actually  this next year in 2026 new date and time instead of being at the end of March it's going to be at the end of February and it is going to be what they say like an hour away from where is currently been held I believe but if you want to check out Sacred Space conference.org you can get more information and they're already starting early registration we are hoping to be at several other festivals you can check out our website back on a broomstick.com we have a whole list of festivals that are going on son will be at some we won't you can also check out mandragora magic. They have a list of pagan festivals maybe in your state and you know I think that some of our listeners that went to this in this was kind of their first time cuz I know there was one or two that this was their first time doing something like this I think they would agree with us when we say give it a try go at least once because you will learn so much and meet so many great people the amount that you will learn  something like this is overwhelming absolutely Festival weather is in the woods or in a hotel definitely worth it I will thank you so much for listening to this episode of back on the broomstick we will be posting some pictures from a ritual and maybe I can convince Sal to record that beautiful island of the ways call that she didn't put that up along with the medication for you guys coming up in the next couple weeks maybe you'll let me say the whole thing all right thank you again for listening people see you next week on back on the broomstick please give us some likes and review some stars that really helps the show out and it makes L&I cackle like a little witches  and keep it Richie

harmony with the Land Lacey pervades the 4th generation folk healer and ordained Priestess of the Goddess a teacher and the creative force behind the Cozy witchy Hearth and Home Haven that has been

but all so beautifully integrate into your everyday life for work honors the old ways while feeling refreshingly modern and accessible today will be chatting with Lacey about her new book naturally modernmagic her path as a house which and how we can all bring more seasonal and Soulful magic in you are home I and welcome to the show Lacey hello thank you for having me I'm so excited to be here and I can't wait to talk about  witchcraft it's one of her favorite topics to talk about your latest book natural Modern Magic but we do want to give you a second tell us a little bit about tell us about you and your your magical journey it started I guess from birth old wives tales and my mom was always so there was just a sort of are of looking at things differently and ever since I can remember and when I was about five I found some tarot cards in my mom so you started very young but I've been doing it almost all my life and now I help which is developed a practice that lives with everyday life and how to learn while practicing because that's what witchcraft is is your practice unless that Lacey one of the things that I really love when I heard about your book and I started finding out about you with I found her YouTube channel naturally  which YouTube channel and you have videos on there about the wheel of the year and you show how you celebrate and what you do in your home and they are just so magical and just filled with so many little things that people can do in their own lives you make witchcraft very accessible can you tell us about that Journey how you came to do that thank you thank you for that feedback accessible is definitely what I'm all about something that slows with your life and for me living by the seasons in the Moon is that foundation and connecting with your natural world you are a region in your environment and then taking inspiration from that so you know we use the plastic wheel is the wheel I use those words because that's what people are starting out at or for often times how do I celebrate All Star at how do I celebrate you know whatever whatever is coming up next then but what it really is about inspiration from your experience with your environment  have you seen magic how you look at things differently you know you're not a witch because you do things differently you're a witch because he's see things differently everyday life so that's really where the inspiration comes is what were the things that I felt most magical doing or that I could see a deeper meaning and that I was already doing so I'm already a frosty Martha Stewart type of home homemade bread type of person I resemble that remark I love all of those things that Encompass what we might call gymnastic magic stuff Kitchen Magic House magic and I love that term domestic Magic  what we are domesticated which is at this point you know it's not that which living on the edge of civilization in the woods and that's kind of that energy you know how would I do this if it was just me and connecting to Magic how would I how would I celebrate this and whatever I was already doing I was so it would start very small you were talking about you during your intention into your teeth brushing your teeth with intention you're cleansing or you only want to speak sweet words or you're eating something and you look at that keeper meeting that correspondence or symbolism until I would do that with my YouTube channel is big for grain and so if we can do that but where is what grows most easily and is native to where I'm at where I live in Las Vegas in the desert  that experience and then make something with that type of brain candy that was the bigger connection other than just reading is to look at the deeper meaning and for one of her got ideas and inspiration for people who are crafty who like to cook like to be in your garden but also see that deeper connection history was very similar to Shell and I you started out very Wicked bass and we likes us laugh and say we have with his DNA we don't practice Wicca right now but it's still influences our magical practice in a big way and I also resonated with when you said that you moved and found that your new area didn't really follow the same seasons the same wheel of the year that you were used to so that really helps kind of ground you and more of us a local animistic type practice can you tell us about that Journey a little bit  in 1999 or early 2000 which is of a Scottish I was a couple books from Barnes & Noble you know that little section needs to have them religion there's like seven books on witchcraft the complete idiot's guide to something like that something really early on I remember when she got first and then she got something like that and she thought Every Woman a goddess or something about those really the first times I really like it I really truly learned about it and she didn't take to it as much but oh I ate it I got onto the internet in the early days on  I found the learning circle and its roof and we meet at a coffee shop and I receive youngest I was 11 12 I don't even know if they are but they're all older than me and there is some some grown-ups there too so it was a nice next about 10 people would gather and we three different books and just talk and people are quite open to everyone I think at the time most people for the last decade or so had access to which in information that was what was easily available and I think I have the jumping-off point for a lot of people often start there if I'm entering someone or we're learning about it you know what we'll use those, but we speak that language a language I speak  yep we're with you yeah that plays very heavily into how I write spells and I wrote that the cells in the book and crafts at them are those correspondences because I learned that from my which in route but it is about adapting it you know what we're looking at connecting with nature where where is your connection so yeah it did have to eventually adjust that looks different here spring is beautiful in the desert come here in May and it is just gorgeous when you find a wild flowers but it looks very different in the winter but you really have to look at those and that's the magic is a big part of it is the presents in observing that's a lot of Witchcraft I'm going to inject real quick I know she'll have a question but coming from the East Coast I live  Southern California for time at in the desert and Joshua tree is one of my most magical places but when I first went there it was so different it felt so alien it it took a minute but then once I felt the magic of the land and connected with the life there it was so amazing different but absolutely stunningly amazing so I just had to share my love for the desert for just a second actually I was going to interject I I have not been to the desert and I'm just going to put that out there bucket list thing but I did have a drastic move within the last 5 years that did change my perspective a little bit I went from the heart of the Deep Woods of Upstate New York where are you know Forest magic is abound in that location to Salem Massachusetts where water magic was very prevalent here you know I'm I'm a mile from the ocean the wind is a whole different thing are it  self is different here than it was back in New York and it just has this different the only way I can explain it is a different soul feel like that that Forest which two kind of like that ocean a water witch five changes like that happen and we have to adapt to those and I think yeah that's a big part of your story is how you adapted to all these changes and beautifully from what it looks like you know you have this website and you do teachings as well I do so we have the best free anyone can find one with a thing you can do everyday to connect to your craft and you know where is a little more magically but the patron has the coven and that's where we get into more resources with living by the seasons in the moon and then I'll do periodic inventory mentorship so sometimes it will be on patreon sometimes it'll be 10  once the book The compendium of spells and rituals for health happiness and prosperity I love how you almost start from scratch and going through the book is like a work through like a progression what inspired you to make this beautiful thing because I do have to also point out that visually I love this book more than any book I have seen in a very very long time for someone who sometimes has a hard time sitting down and swallowing a whole book just visually this makes me want to turn the page and turn the page you've got little Graphics a little pictures and the pop up ideas I love your little pop-up ideas what inspired the book and kind of the format that you that  went because I love that more than anything I've seen in a long time don't you that's quite a compliment it really has come together beautifully visually what is a scrapbook you know I can junk Journal sort of feeling sucks but it reminds me of they had a certain vision and I wasn't sure how much I could speak up and I've learned to advocate for myself now that's a great lesson so in the beginning I took a couple pictures of some scrapbooks and books that we were put together in that for style and I told him this is what I'm most inspired by even before that in 2019 maybe 20 20 eye when I first started really diving into this and offering teachings and things like that  it looks like this was my witches Journal I just opened it up and you saw Pages me nature journaling and there is a pressed flower in there or you flipped it over and there's a sketch of a buzz or some symbol in my coffee when I was interpreting clouds of creamer and how it's laid out the way that it is I wanted it to be something that you learned witchcraft while you were practicing it because so many of us get wrapped up and you can sue me information information information and there's no shortage of information we just need to know what to do with it so the introductions before every spell is to tell you this does that sisters that is why were using it and then if you don't have an ingredient that's okay we're just stacking the odds in your favor things together if you don't have it a little bit do what feels right or slip to the substitutions in the back so we started with what was what was the bare-bones let me tell you about grounding  tell you got protection and we move through anything that I thought would go through your life I wanted it to be a spell book is like a cookbooks do I wanted it to be a go to you needed a recipe for cooked chicken you pull your favorite cookbook out and you flipped you a recipe for cooked lemon chicken and so you need a spell to get your dream job you just failed to attract the right love you need to spell stop gossip you need a spell to protect yourself while you're on a road trip you know I wanted them to be everyday situations that we all go through like you said we get so consumed with info overload that okay now that I've downloaded all this info to my brain now what do I do with it I like how you have small chunks of very important information you need to know about this particular thing now let's put it into practice I very much enjoyed how it does look like a scrapbook cookbook to me and I like  color tabs at the top where you can see all the different sections very easily one of the things that you said about doing magic is something that shell and I think is very important as we think even if you're not going to do it right or you don't think you're going to do it the right way to do it got messy get 30 first of all I loved your medication I think it was in the book if it was so fun and so cute and so personal I want to hang out with your brother by the way because it's really well known in their well I am shout out to Don t forget. I have four of them and we get along very well so I'm big fan of Brothers but I did like your dedication to your dad I wanted to call this out because he had a saying to shoot for the stars and if you make it over the trees yeah and I I appreciate that because you  we should try even if you don't think you're going to get to the Stars you still need to try and you still need to try to do it and not making it to the Stars doesn't mean that you failed it just means you learned something it means you learned what to do next time you got as far as the top of the trees there's so much there and I think magic needs to be less I mean or needs to be the cerebro part you need that part but you also need to get messy witchcraft is being outside it's being in the woods walking through the mud is trial and error recipes doing all this it's living it's being alive and and that's can be messy and I think we need to embrace that a little bit how do you add that process of not being afraid to make mistakes or not being afraid to not quite reach the Stars how do you how do you work with that internet I say my biggest lesson that I learned that from an experienced in my experiences with gardening especially out here in the desert I love a good Garden but it has taken me quite some time  at one point I looked around and everything was dead but I know looking at it a little bit longer I thought well this probably could have gone over there and gotten better son or less son and you probably needed or maybe if I can pandan plant with some shade or this might have needed more water. This isn't a yard full of dead plants because they are full of lessons and everything has season and so even looking at those dry crispy plants at one point I realized this is just the plants is this just what early fall looks like in the desert we don't have leaves falling but we have things getting dry and Christy maybe this is just that cycle in this is what it looks like here so  try something see how it feels see how it works and what is the deeper meaning what is the thing what is the magic magic is what connection to the Divine whatever that is for you and so what is that thread you know what you mean learn because that's a lot of the wisdom in the knowledge the difference between just taking in information and knowing what to do with it I have another question I was also taking a look at your website and on it you have a Beltane love spell cake yes and part of that recipe is for some lavender honey butter yes yes so delicious so good just the lavender honey butter how fun to mix a little magic into that and drizzle. On my loves toes do you know on a on a little bit of something sweet to eat and just kind of add a little bit of that I love you magic to it so what's your favorite way to add you know I love you to food I would say that  the go to that I I do the most is during an intention so clockwise attract or something like that and I use my numerology number is a lots of things and she has a cell 3. Use of whatever that ingredient might be that I'm using you just look at that face I think of a couple ingredients in any mail that I'm making pick one meal that we pick one ingredient slime that meal and then learn about it like it's actually your use it enough you'll develop a relationship with that ingredient it'll become what I call a spiritual can do just no longer tool it's that relationship know if you do Italian seasoning a lot well pick one or all the ingredients in Italian seasoning and learn about them  take that to Green magic and use those herbs and other spouse you can even get rid of those little arrow Gardens I think that have like Italian seasoning pods that you can just grow in your little AeroGarden that would be fun yes Layla mentioned love magic I have a question I feel like everybody's looking for a love spell you know how am I going to get this person get the person I love whatever the case maybe it's a buzzword always has been I want to point out that I love the fact that your love and relationship section was more towards the back of your book I want to ask did you feel compelled to have to add something about love and relationships because it is such a hot thing I I added it because it just seems like something that people would go through so I would start there and I was very careful not to include anything that was a low  spell on a specific person because if I had to look back on the people I would have cast Les filles on I would have picked the wrong one of those things before you give it up to the university Give It Up to mystery or whatever your Divine Essence is for you that I might pick up something out there might know better and so and styles with this or something better or some laws that okay this is what I'm communicating that I see with my mental World in my physical world and maybe are not as connected to the spirit world to see what something else be so this is what I have I think I want with the resources that I have but let it be this or something better and I I trust that the trust fall which is difficult but there is a part of that you don't need to control everything sometimes we need to let it happen and you evolve into an eclipse  we don't need to control everything because I think that sometimes people think that doing magic is controller yourself my control freak friend I have a control to control everything I guess is my point and I like that you kind of convey that yeah well in the interesting part is there is a spell to keep you from wanting to control situations  so it's a bit of a spiral down the circle the air down our down the rabbit hole was not going to go down that one I think the Spells and rituals in a way they help you to release recently done a lot of work with my cognitive function and limiting beliefs and things like that and I think that's very important to your focus and attention when doing still work or any type of magic that really Groton Center your energy and be able to focus on the feeling that you want in The Circle at that time in your working at that time being able to get out of that monkey mind and should release and trust that you've done what you can and still work really helps with that we have that symbolic action communication  I think communicate as much as she'll really like that the love spells were at the end I very much enjoy that that your energy work grounding and censoring you talk about that very in-depth at the beginning was front and center because that's so important it's so important to everything from that point on I feel ya and you have charms to ground you have cleansing ideas in here and then you really give people a great grounding and how to ground and how to work with that energy how to center yourself because if you can't round and Center Andreas that energy is very difficult to venture X it and try to work their will that way so I love that you had that front and center right there now it was speaking of cleansing I noticed that as a domestic which is now she'll and I talked about this weekend to talk about the wheel of the year we do a lot of cleansing weather is an ulcer whether it's our whole house and you talked about that a lot of your channel and your website so I have a personal question  do you have sitting around your house and the unlabeled bottles of moon water and what do you do with them solutely absolutely okay so it's not just us I gotten better over the years I used to have everything unlabeled cuz of course I'm going to remember this I don't usually okay as hard you don't really know where it came from but at the very least I will use it to wash clothes I put it in my laundry so if I don't know how long it's been around and you know I don't consume it or something like that at least put it in my laundry put it in ice cubes in Springs at keeping your freezer that way you know if you wanted to drink it or something like that I like to do sprays I like to put it in my water and drink it and do things like that so you know  safer than you have ice cubes so it might brew iced coffee before then he's not moving water in your ice cubes and water so I find ice breathing underwater to be really handy I have a problem I think 9 bottles all unlabeled and I do remember that one of them that I feel like is in a Snapple bottle but I have a few of them was from like thunder and lightning struck the first big storm when I moved and I'm afraid to open any of these Snapple bottles cuz I don't know which one has that chaotic energy in it I would probably sit with each of them and see how they energetically feel to see your pretty face and then if you still were a little unsure maybe a little salt in them  careful, those energy used to clean the area under your least favorite co-worker is chair yeah you could actually you could spend at the other out yeah we're not the only ones with a few unlabeled jars with things kicking her out I always say I'm going to remember and then I never do never ever I'm getting a little better if you had to give one piece of of starting advice to someone who came to you and said look I'm very new to Witchcraft I don't know where to start I don't know what to look at and don't know what is your advice to play very new which the first thing you need to ask yourself is if you are looking for a new religion or spiritual beliefs or Israel  Bernie practice because you can practice Witchcraft and Magic no matter your religion or spiritual beliefs you need to decide where you want to start start with learning about symbolism responses and practice do you want to start learning about spiritual beliefs and religion do you want to do a little bit of a particular or exercise that you do teach your students first is there something that you give them to work with in the beginning the first thing we work with is their personal daily Rhythm and then crying about because if you're trying to make your practice fit into everyday life even if you've never done any type of Witchcraft or magic or studied anything you need to understand how you work are you a morning person or are you a night person I'm a morning person so I like to do a lot of my stuff early as the sun is rising so they're certain correspondences  different kinds of your energy is feeling different ways you're going to know your your Rhythm and your schedule so that's one of the first things that I get people to look into when their evaluation before we get started and then started when I read a book called How To Read Literature Like a Professor and they explained that when you're reading for example mythology or your reading different types of literature and stuff like that to look at the symbolism so in this case what is the collective symbolism in what is a personal symbolism that you have with things that might show up in your life so it's a butterfly passes You by you might use that as your subject symbolism there, not its transformation but maybe you have a particular connections and butterflies and then that comes to memory what are your memories associated with this and then where is it showing up  over again one really chain into your awareness your presence in natural environment and energies around you and then it's also going to help you learn to interpret signs and symbols in the future if that's something that you got more into and also it's going to help you learn about correspondence this so it's going to help you learn about the energies with your tools which will hopefully become spiritual students in your Mentor used to journal I was just going to say I heard all over that we do mostly due nature Journal so we start with nature journaling and you'll pick us up Jackson you'll look at the deeper meaning of that subject that's outside and you study it for an entire year and each season you learn something from that tree and that eventually becomes your seasonal wheel or your New Year wishes we all your waking me up in a year  personal that really brings it down to you I love that so much I love it because it gives folks butterfly mean to me maybe something completely different to you so it's teaching about download of information that's so wonderful but then personalizing it to what does this mean to me personally how do I feel personally how does this affect me personally and kind of give it that spent I love that yes absolutely more longer when I say I say Brisa How To Read Literature Like a Professor that's one of the first ones I say to read the next one I would say is history of Witchcraft and magic and something that's a good well-rounded bit of a timeline of magic and Witchcraft so that you can see that it's been practiced throughout history and beliefs  dumb in some form they're just different rules around who and for what reason why those two are really good foundations and so that you can actually get your hands and what their day looks like because in magic all of it as Cycles the wheel of the year is the wheel of the month is the wheel of the day is you know what the the cycle of you and it reminded me of a book that I read when my kids were little with called seven times the sun it's about finding TV rhythms with your children and not a pagan book I believe say Darien is the author but not a pagan book but I think finding those rhythms and finding what you do naturally during the day that you can make magical that you can make part of your practice helps to make it easier to do if you're trying to do something completely out of the norm to you completely out  your Cycles in your rhythms you're less likely to keep doing it that's why if you cook everyday cook a little magic into that you know work a little magic into that are there any things that you do during the day that used to be quote-unquote normal are mundane that are now magical for you is there anything like that and your daily practice oh absolutely absolutely I say once I really started the grounding and I bought them Ashley modern which method and I I looked at what I did to get more connected to my craft and have a practice that just really slow and then I wrote it all out and then I repeated what I learned everyone has their own slow magic energy worksman Cycles in ribbons just like you were saying and what we often times will do is it just becomes brick  go on autopilot and life shouldn't be automatic you know I shouldn't be so being more present one thing that you can talk about cleansing that I find really helpful is to look at that correspondence of things that are cleansing so when is water being used washing the dishes like you just said or taking a shower you can make that into a cleansing ritual if you're doing something with your hair braiding it or putting it up in a certain way if you're already wearing at Scott's at day know if you need to Shield yourself and those things can be really helpful that is the star of Cycles around it and I was working on sort of a time of self-love when I got  and I still got this downloader this message that was I needed something that made me feel sacred so that's something that I always charge it every day where I put water on it so I know I'm wearing that regularly include that in my practice I know I'm showering regularly some parts of the book you'll see a recipe and my editor even sent me an email about it she said I just realized this is fire cider making interest out if you first learn the deeper meaning of course you can make all of life life naturally Modern Magic next door inspired to be the crazy witch in the woods but which next door works to either one  life but we have that connection you know we have that that yearning that fool to natural magic with nature in some way but you know we live in front of screens book definitely gives folks a good idea to how to bridge that Gap thank you so much Lacey for joining us at your book

----------------------------------------
welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire to witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to it back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode will be talking about two topics that are near and dear to my witty heart the upcoming Festival season and listener questions and I'm sure she'll and nothing really Sparks the summer off like a good Festival we're going to not only talk about some of the festivals that we love that we go to work shops app we're going to mention some that maybe your in your local area we know that is a very difficult for people to find witches in their area sometimes you go to your local metaphysical shop or maybe you go to the local union church but there's not always those things around either so finding festivals that are in your state or in your area that you can go to to be a wonderful way to meet a lot of other witches and pagans and also we're going to talk about some of the ones that we're going to be at if you want to meet us at some of these festivals  there's always more questions than we can get to but we randomly picked some and if we didn't get your question this time we will try to get to next time there's lots of ways that you can ask us you can send us DMS on Instagram you can send us emails you can also on Spotify you can send messages on each individual episode and on our hosting service buzzsprout they also have a way for people to send in questions but I can't respond to them so we actually went into that section and got some questions there to answer on here waiting area if you can't respond that makes zero sense it does and I asked them and they said it's so that you could answer them on air and I don't think they realize how many questions that we get it would be a lot easier to just type up a bus route going to start with some festivals including the one that we've been talking about an awful lot the upcoming Sacred Space conference in Townsend Maryland at the edge  end of March I've already started packing that's all I'm going to say tell and I went last year and we each did workshops on cannabis magic and tea magic and this year we were lucky enough to be invited back and we are doing a workshop together this time we're doing a meditation ritual this is actually going to be great and it's not just because it's just because we're doing it but we are actually going to do a ritual that is transformative going on a journey and you're going to meet your inner fool in this workshop and I'm excited to do it even working on this particular ritual workshop for 9 months 8 9 months now pretty seriously secret space conference has been going for several years and again they are in Towson Maryland and business considered a intermediate to Advanced practitioner conference and that's one of the things that I really enjoy  about it but don't get us wrong. That is not like a requirement you know the newbies obviously can participate in this but they are definitely kind of Next Level the kinda intense and so much information so much fun the people who put it on who hosted are just amazing wonderful witches this is an indoor conference and it's in a hotel it's a multi-day conference indoors and there's workshops all day long that you can go to fairy which the environment there's vendors musical performances rituals workshops but you also have to be cognizant you are also in a public hotel right there's more people than just our conference there that's one of the first ones in the year as the secret space conference but you know it doesn't end there festivals basically start around this time of year but then go out  Fruita fall so we do want to mention again not just the ones that were were participating in also to kind of Bounce to the middle of the country whose got the Austin witchfest this takes place in Austin Texas and it is a celebration dedicated to the education and practice of Witchcraft just like a Sacred Space there's workshops there's vendors there's rituals and it gives you an opportunity to learn and connect with fellow pagans in that area so for anybody in the Texas region check out Austin witchfest because that's going to be happening basically during the same time sacred spaces in May and this is one that sadly I haven't gone through yet and I don't know why because we know so many people that go to this particular basketball  pics of spring and this is in Western Massachusetts and it is it's an annual Gathering to celebrate the Earth they do workshops rituals music it's May 20th through 25th this year and they have it out in the woods basically but it's not like tent camping there's cabins they have communal cabins they have some smaller cabins some of them have here they all have showers there's a main building where they have food so you can buy like a meal plan for the week or you can bring your own food so it's all about community and being part of the community so you work together you go to workshops together I you do rituals you eat together that sounds super communal which I love really is this is more like our old Pagan community and it's funny because yeah which is how we actually heard about it we're going even though we haven't have now I believe this year it's $300 if you get a ticket early and then another 20  dollars if you get the full meal plan so it's not something I've ever really been able to swing in the budget but this year I'm I'm actually doing some side hustles man to try it really is and everything I've ever heard about it is that it's it's fantastic Community wonderful magic the workshops are just really really good now I want to go maybe this year maybe we'll see what is fantastic there's also the New York State ferry Festival that's in Sherman New York and that's the weekend of June 27th 28th and 29th this year while not technically a pagan Festival it is very Pagan and if you do get to Camp you'll be treated to all sorts of performances after hours Shenanigans and just a wonderful amazing group of witches pagans and very loving people of all kinds to the south of little bit this one this is another one  I've had an interest in for a couple of years and I'm just not been able to put it on my calendar yet Mystic South I don't know if you get time this isn't Atlanta Georgia and this kind of is more about mysticism paganism alternative spirituality again workshops rituals presentation this Earth Spirit this is intended to create that Community sense that just the title Mystic South kind of drawers me into want to go and they always have excellent presenters now I believe Mystic South is another one that's an indoor Hotel kind of thing as an indoor conference type of wine so you do you get a slightly different atmosphere what is indoors but I had a blast it was absolutely wonderful and the bed was much more comfortable indoor than it is  my go camping you know I just just a side note I remember one time that we were at a festival and we were camping and you know call it a microburst call it a tornado either way we thought we were going to die that night you know you don't get that at a hotel conference just saying it looks another bucket list Festival last year we did go to witches Fest USA which is in New York City New York this year it'll be a July 12th and it is a one day celebration that has workshops that has performances it was one street that was closed down that had boots and Tents set up along each side of the street and it was a lot of fun there are a lot of people this is a festival where we got recognized for the first time in the wild we were like wait they're talking about  you know maybe it's because I'm a New Yorker but you cannot have a bad time in New York City a bunch of witches and pagans kind of laid out on the street for the afternoon that's a vibe that you can't beat last year I was wearing a tank top and my loose flowy is pants and I still think I was a puddle of Sweat by the end of the day it was so hot and we still had an amazing time yeah yeah there was that but they had belly dancers in the street and they had musicians in the vendors top-notch by the way they have at Harper playing savage daughter she was great absolutely and then you know again awesome workshops you know that that just that sense of everybody that has a similar mindset that crowded into one small area  look for a little while now it's being held in Pomeroy Ohio and it has been for quite a few years the Wisteria Campground in Pomeroy Ohio and that is the Starwood Festival Starwood the year is July 15th through 21st so it does kind of overlap a little bit with some of Brushwood festivals so you'll have to pick and choose unfortunately but Starwood is another camping outdoor Festival bonfires rituals workshops amazing what you people know the next one I'm actually going to let you talk about it real quick because this is your job, but let's talk about the next two together it's at a place that is both of our Jam Western New York and Brushwood Center the first Festival is called the Sankofa Festival Sankofa to Sankofa symbol has long been Brushwood symbol it's there it looks like a a curlicue heart will put some pic  the idea of it is to not leave things undone or not to leave things behind to take care of things when you can explain to me when we first started going is that Sankofa we word from a tribe in Ghana in Africa and very powerful phrase that means to go back and get it the idea of it is that you should not forget the past that it's okay to go back for what you left behind you should remember your past in order to make progress in the future you have to remember the past you know take care of other things behind you 10 or 15 years ago they decided to have a festival and called it Sankofa and from their website they say that the Sankofa Festival is quote to celebrate the creative spirit and it's the weekend before serious Rising what kind of makes it fun is they set it up where it's almost like back-to-back festivals like the lead in shorter Festival to the Sirius Rising Festival that has been going  435 36 years now very large Festival serious Rising starting so that the minute senko Fighters over the next day starts the Sirius Rising Festival Festival you just want a weekend where you go and every day is going to have workshops is going to have performances there's a karaoke on Saturday night. In my opinion big bonfires and drumming in the round house every single night under the stars and then a larger bonfire at the end to celebrate the end of it of the festival a wonderful time and a lot of learning can be had in a lot of connection  and they also have some cabins and RVs that you could rent to stay another's are limited so you need to to sign up for those pretty quickly but you can camp you can RV camp you can also rent a cabin or an RV from them as well to say they also have hot showers now fresh was before Center is so once you go around the bend after you get down from the main buildings it is entirely clothing optional so you will see nudity in places and we've talked in the past about etiquette regarding clothing-optional Place definitely want to let you know that if you plan on going you going to see some Eddie Berry's you do not need to show your anybody's if you don't want to you can dress in your witchy finest you can dress them whatever you like or undress and whatever you like I think the takeaway is they do some bomb-ass festivals you know we used to go to Serious Rising every single year back in the day and like  it was like the highlight of my summer we ended up getting a seasonal campsite double seasonals out there every year because we love these festivals so much serious Rising is the bigger Festival that comes after Sankofa that is July 21st through 27th again at Brushwood folklore Center in Sherman New York now this one every day hey is dedicated to a different element so Monday is air Tuesday is fire Wednesday why don't you get the picture till on Saturday night they have the big huge end of Festival bonfire that is literally several stories tall to be a good Saturday at least 30 ft each of these days around a specific element and there's workshops performances and then  fabulous all night drum circles dancing there's a didgeridoo Dome it's just amazing it will blow your mind I don't know about you I did my first one and you did it with me there but I did my first Mandela there Catherine Cartwright Jones we used to work with ccj John all the henna and some of the workshops are to work with the round house which is it's an open-air structure that's built of a lot of Beltane bowls shelter on one side and it's dirt floor and in the center is usually a large bonfire every night and sometimes we would break the sand around the bonfire and draw a labret Mandela's and designs to dance into the dirt later that night as we celebrated each element everyday  all night long to watch the game at both of them as well and hopefully I am hoping to be presenting as well so yeah there's that but we'll see we haven't heard back yet most Colorado and that's July 30th to August 3rd this year and we did get to talk to the wonderful people from Dragon fest last year you can check out that episode out link it in the show description but that is also another fantastic outdoor very wonderful witchy Festival sadly we have not yet gone to just makes me want to go but just say I love, Colorado so magical do I live there for a little while in Leadville Colorado actually it just feels magical until Monday so  Temple Fest this is actually a little closer to to where I'm at this is going to be in Carlton Massachusetts this is end of August like a Labor Day weekend this again you know celebrating Pagan and Witchcraft traditions this they do a lot of community building and you know the same thing as rituals workshops presentation this year so I will be at Temple Fest Leila will be with me I am there in a support capacity but I will be there enjoying time with us as well so hopefully you guys can come see if you are in the western Mass or Eastern New York Region or any surrounding area get your booty to Temple fast because this is going to be a good time  we don't know the layout on this one yet whether they have cabins or tents you know anything about it so I do know that there is cabin options I am still looking into accommodations because I just recently found out I was accepted so I'll have to get back to you on that this next one is a one-day festival and it's getting more and more popular every year and you'll see these crop up especially in bigger cities usually the end of August through September and I'm talking about pagan Pride Day last year we had wonderful fun and joy of presenting at the central New York Pagan Pride cuz we got accepted for that back when I lived in New York neither of us live in New York this year so we're thinking about maybe we'll meet up cuz kind of central to us so maybe we'll try that again or maybe we'll find a different Pagan Pride this year or not sure yet fabulous people in central New York and that was such a  will experience going back to our charms episode I still have all the acorns I pocketed that day because their local you're going to meet people for the most part that are local to you yeah least within a few hours again most major cities will have them nowadays the very first Pagan Pride day that shall and I went to was shortly after the 9/11 attacks actually it was in 2001 I still have some pretty crazy pictures from that but we had planned to go and visit our friend who lived in New York City who was part of our cabin and that was a sobering experience it was kind of a strange introduction to pay but yeah it's pretty it's pretty deep but Pagan Prides are growing every year and I just think it's wonderful that they're back  was New York City New York City and in we were three hours or every major city has won New York I think I just wanted if the New York state has a ton of them here in Pennsylvania I've seen him in Harrisburg Philly they're all over and you should be able to find something local in your area or go to what does it mean to 3 hour radius of you cuz they literally are everywhere now and like you said it's called Pagan pride and different groups in different cities I don't want to say there's not a designated date on a calendar but it's almost like some time within that month almost like September itself is like Pagan pride month so they're going to be  exactly most of the ones I see are very late August through September if for nothing else network with your local witches people from a land that you love there is one out in California that we have on our list this is called hexenfest and this is October 9th through 12th and it's in Upper Lake California this is Music and Arts Festival for witchy creative and Visionary types they explore seems like otherworldly and a Mystic Mystic Pagan Fairy Tail and they provide a space for inspiration and community that they like it like that entwine music with it I like that honestly most of the ones that we've ever been to will have flamingos have different musical acts  China promotes music is part of it when the rule is a name you probably know and she is playing on Hexum fast on Saturday night so if that gives you an idea interesting I don't know how quickly I can get to California. Yeah we're going to wrap up in this is I like to think of this Festival is a part 2 so we talked about Earth Spirit in western Mass earlier in the spring they also in the fall have a festival called Twilight governing this is the one I have to go to know I'm confused and you may know more and you can correct me but do you have to go to Rites of Spring to be able to go to Twilight coveting suggested idea is that you should really  how to write the spring first because the idea is Twilight is intense it's three days of intense magic this was deep deep this is probably the deepest spiritual one out of all of them like immersive spiritual magical work and you go there not to party with can be a very strong but I'm through a lot of these special but you go there to do the work and so it was suggested that you go to Rites of Spring first before you went to Twilight company now that's not necessary although its preferred but not necessary at all the cool thing about Twilight coveting is that they have plans when you sign up you don't just sign up to go and then you just say oh at these different workshops every day you sign up for a specific Clan  and each Clan will be like the spider Clan or the grandmother claimed I got into a house kind of like it'll be different at different levels of magic or maybe I'll be more for beginners or more for you know people who are into meditating each one will have a different focus and so you pick what you want to focus on magically and your request to be in one of three Clans should I love that yeah and so you won't know what Clan you get until after everybody is signed up then they go to Earth Spirit the community goes through and tries to balance all these plans so then you'll find out which of the three you chose you actually got into my God I love that every year I look at these plans and I'm just like I want to do this so bad. Called again  it has been on my bucket list for far too long and I really really want to call this year so bad this is the one this is the one that's really deep apologize that we didn't focus a whole ton on Midwest and Western ones they're hard to find an inn where so unfamiliar but go to the website mandragora Magicka and they have listings of festivals on their Layla and I have a list and I am sure I can coax Layla into putting it in the show notes exactly but I just think if for nothing else the networking opportunities and you know if you have one local to you and you're you're afraid to commit to a weekend or a week-long get a day pass go check it out and see if it if that's interested in  Syrian sweater there in hotels Conference Centers in the middle of the woods I recommend everybody go to a festival at least once as many as you can but the kind of freaked out the fun parts of a few go to Sacred Space or Temple fast or Sankofa or serious Rising you are going to have a late lunch so I think that is our list now that is not a comprehensive list there are a lot more festivals times that we didn't get time to mention I will put a link to your mandragora Magica as well as all the festivals that we've listed okay now the other thing that I absolutely love other than festivals is talking and we have a grab bag of question question question I'm sorry I don't have your name but this person wrote in I was wondering if there was some spell work or information on witchcraft for those for recovery  from PTSD and things like that what can we do to move on and he'll meditate would probably be my first thing to be honest with you try to find a meditation you know for me personally I was go back to that Crystal countdown meditation but find a meditation that works for you that you can do whether the daily every other day we find one and stick with that one meditation and do it repetitively for a lot of people trauma it can really leave you feeling not connected to yourself physically not connected to your physical body and so doing breathwork doing meditation can really help to slow you down and help you to find comfort and in that connection again and it can kind of help you get out of that stress mode that fight or flight mode and also a daily  Cactus finding a daily practice that you can lean into whether a stop meditation or tarot card fault or brewing a special cup of tea you know every day with intention to try and bring yourself back to a peaceful moment and be something that you can really do I guess the bottom line is if not me but 5 to 10 minutes a day or you can just kind of become one with yourself and if you can find some time to do some spell work and create an incense incense blend that I like for relaxation chamomile Lavender Blue Lotus and frankincense you can mix those together with intention and then use a little bit of that as it's Bailey incensed when you're doing this practice especially if you can be in a peaceful State when you create that incense that will carry over that every time you burn that incense it will help to bring you back to that peaceful state that centered state that can help you find a little bit of normal  be in peace in the middle of that stress and I think that's where the repetitiveness comes in is it kind of gives you a focal point for the future when you know when you find yourself starting to Spiro default to that specific thing and out of repetitiveness it automatically down in a calming space with incense and candle light that just the act of pulling them in kind of bring me back to that relaxation State Journal whoever wrote this or to anyone else that's in our audience is suffering with PTSD or anxiety or stress especially nowadays we get it just know that we hear you and know that healing doesn't always look the same for everybody it's not always a straight line some days are going to be easier than others but magic and witchcraft  is at its deepest form about reclaiming who you are about being who you are feeling about healing yourself but know that you're on the path know that we're here with you know some days we feel the same way in your podcast every episode leaves me with new insight and questions to be respectful of your time I'll ask about the swords versus Juan's representations your episode discussing this controversy was very helpful and validating I'm struggling because it isn't a 14-1 switch for me it's close but not complete is there a method of learning Terrell in this situation is it a good idea to further explore with wands and swords each means to me I can't help but feel discomfort at losing something from a card if I recreate meaning of these two suits and how does this affect my understanding of how these cars  the elements directions and astrology each of those are big questions thank you for sharing all that you do warmly Dawn from Rhode Island John also says that she lives on Seneca lake in ha no shit yeah so hey it's on I also grew up on Seneca Lake how fun hey Don I grew up about an hour from Seneca Lake first I think the first reaction I have to the first question is your cards are going to do you the best Justice in your relationship with your cards in the messages you received from the cards are going to be best with what you feel and just because the book says whatever who gives a shit if you feel that swords means are that's what you're going to get out of those cards so we don't want you to feel uncomfortable with you know how you feel versus what the books or that the the pamphlet says  for those cards to do their Justice to you and your intentions you have to go with what you feel those meetings are for swords and and and Wands and say that if you don't feel like that it has any Elemental correspondence that's okay too if you're not comfortable those and they don't seem to suit you or how you read or your cards just throw him out don't even use those how do swords feel for you like do they feel strong do they feel angry do they feel passionate do they feel intellectual do they feel like conversation like what do they feel like to you and that's where we're daily Paul's and journaling come and see him because if you write down how it presents itself to you what feelings that gives you you can just go with that you don't need to assign an element to it at all actually I'm going to have to agree with Taro journaling it kills me to say it but I totally agree with it but my relationship with a different than Layla's relationship  the cards that's going to be different than Don's relationship with the cards so you just need to spend time with your cards and in build that relationship and learn what cards are saying what yeah and there's definitely days when I'm reading your car don't like the fire energy is just bouncing off his car and his other days when I read the same card and never think of an element or fire or anything like that at all so it is really going to very on the situation and kind of what's going on in your life and in that particular reading exactly so now the next one I think is really funny because you mentioned this in the first question but alright Aloha from Maui Hawaii I'm so happy to have found your show and I'm really enjoying listening to it I started way back at the beginning and I'm listening through I haven't finished all the episodes those forgive me if you already covered this but on your recommendation I am reading  power of the witch and I'm really enjoying it but I'm having a little trouble with the crystal countdown I'm not exactly sure what she means by seeing the numbers and seeing the Apple are you supposed to literally see it behind your clothes eyes like a hologram or is it more imagining in your mind and holding the image in your mind by you think you could do an episode if you haven't already where you really break down the crystal countdown in a different meditation she talks about in the book like the Apple meditation and visit you store meditation thanks again for this great podcast I'm really enjoying your first of all if and only if you let Layla and I come stay with you in Hawaii  that's right we are absolutely not going to answer it unless we get an invitation to the first question is absolutely yes I picture in my mind's eye an apple with the number on the Apple yes and I'm going to say absolutely no I can't see things in my mind like that really yeah it's so okay alright so I have a thing people have a thing okay some people can in their mind in their minds I have vivid detailed mental pictures they can literally see a picture in their head some people can go so far as to see like a movie in their head moving images in their head and then there's other people like me who have trouble with that and there's actually a thing called aphantasia where there are people who cannot see images at all in their head  I can't I can't and I love meditation so some people are very surprised to find out that I don't see images in my head like that I can't see pictures I never knew that is not funny I didn't realize that other people could do everything is right nothing is wrong kind of yeah but what I do instead when when people talk to me about visualization and the fact that I don't actually see a picture comes up what I realized that I do is it's more of a it's a feeling it's an energy if I'm doing the crystal countdown and I say I imagine like the number nine in your head and say that his friend and my clothes. I think about 9 I think about what it looks like I can't see it but I can think about drawing it or I can think about what it looks like in the real world I can think about what 9 means me and I can think about the colors kind of like symbolic thinking it can be  so you don't actually have to be able to see a picture to do magic or to do meditation and that's what a lot of people like me who have a Fantasia to differing degrees have trouble with sometimes when they hear about spell word for meditation because we don't see pictures and that can be a barrier for some people but symbolic visualization is just as valid and works just as well interesting I didn't know that was a thing where is mine's more like Sesame Street and I see now that I also have face blindness that goes with it which is a little difficult for me I have a very everybody's face looks the same and I can't remember what anybody looks like unless I know you glad you remember I've known you for decades I know your face as well as I know my own good keep it that way but yeah so are wonderful Hawaii listener Aloha but yeah so I love that you're enjoying power of the witch it's a  I love the crystal countdown meditation fantastic don't worry about not being able to actually see them work on the sensation of 9 I guess work on the heels or think about it the more makes you feel how do you feel when you think of bright yellow what are the sensations about it I am not exactly sure how to describe how I quote unquote visualize things but it's kind of like that we would love to do an episode in the future where we talked about the crystal countdown meditation in particular and in-depth and we'll talk about all sorts of different ways to to use that in your practice absolutely vital stuff Hawaii there you go see we answered a question now you owe us  I think that was the rules I'm pretty sure that was the ripples exactly at least for her it is that's right there you go it's it it's finding now but hopefully we will see some of you guys at upcoming festivals including a secret space coming up the end of this month we've already had a couple people reach out and say that they would like to stop by and say hi so I'm very excited to meet some listeners you know I think this was the funnest part is when we actually get to meet less nervous and I guess last year at festivals I was taken aback but I I just want people to know that we love meeting you as much as you love meeting us and you already have permission to give us big hugs come on now say hi where they're flagging sound from across the conference room where into it will say hi to lutely all right I got a pack I got to go we have got to go pack we're so excited about all of this we have so much stuff I have so many books that I want to get to sign you know  great lineup this year and I just I'm flabbergasted and I'm honored to be able for us to do this with the lineup that's there I can't wait I'm not sure 5 to get us in there but keep doing what I do know is if I don't go pack I ain't going anywhere thank you all so much for listening to this episode of please like subscribe give us some Stars give us some reviews we love it and it helps to show out send us an email at back on the broomstick at gmail.com send us something in the snail mail back on the broomstick PO Box 106 Salem Massachusetts 01790 I love getting mail I just want to say that if not we will see you next week on our next episode in the meantime be wise be Wicked and you know what folks Cupid witchy
