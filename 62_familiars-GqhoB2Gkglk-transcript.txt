welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick on this episode we'll be talking about which is familiars are they Spirits is it your cat can your goldfish be a familiar we'll discuss their history how they're thought of in today's Witchcraft and Pagan societies and how you can get yourself a familiar and actually we're also going to answer a listener question that we received about familiars and ready to dive into this fuest of episodes I'm Lea and a happy familiar lover I'm shell I think we should start with what familiars are cuz I think there's a misconception and so why don't we talk about the definition of a familiar or maybe better yet what a familiar is versus what a familiar is not o I love that because they really are different now than they ever have been historically much like a lot of words things change over time and in witchcraft as we use things more often or stop using things you know words change so a familiar is actually referring to a familiar spirit in European history in Scottish history they're typically a spirit that would come to a witch and it was either given to her inherited by her from another more powerful witch or sometimes they'll show up when you need them most and become attached to you but it's a spirit it's not usually an animal like think more Lasher in the Mayfair witches and Less Salem from Sabrina the Teenage Witch sense I like that analogy I do yeah so a familiar spirit is actually in history was a spirit you can find reference to it in the Bible that's more satanic uh typically like there smaller demons you can find references in ancient Egypt in Scottish lore and they all some type of spirit whether it's something that you've called to you or summoned like a demon with a contract or if it's something that was maybe passed down to you from another witch or from a family member that will help you and and it's a spirit that's meant to assist you in your magical workings either by providing energy doing errands casting small spells for you and in particular they're meant to protect you from magical attacks okay now I need to take a left turn here because you know I'm good for that so speaking of Sabrina the Teenage Witch and her familiar I also had a cat for about 20 years that had a name Salem remember Salem I do beautiful Salem kitty cat he was kind of a not to you though and that's the road I'm going down I I did feel like Salem was kind of a familiar like because I do feel like there was that magicalness about him and I mean you knew him the whole 20 years didn't you kind of see that yeah but as you know Salem did have that demon aspect like remember he'd run behind us and put his claws and teeth in the back of your thigh when you'd walk away he did have that that demon side but generally I am not a fan of people thinking their pet is their familiar despite the fact that I feel like I had a cat that was kind of like a familiar yeah he definitely wasn't an ordinary cat by describing the historical familiar I don't want to discredit your magical familiar in Salem at all but he also was not the historical definition of a familiar he was not a spirit of some type that you had called in and then he shapes shifted into a cat form your Salem was more what I like to call the modern version of familiar which is more kind of an animal usually a pet that has a magical affinity and tends to show up and help help you when you're doing your magical works and may even lend their own power to those workings but they're not the traditional sense of a spirit what they are is the modern type of familiar which is more what I would call like an animal helper or a magical companion that's more of the Contemporary version of what we mean by familiar oh no I absolutely agree like you can't really go to the pet store the shelter or whatever hey you got a familiar there I can get yeah give me a familiar or you know your friends like hey I've got kittens you want to adopt one I mean that could be a magical familiar but usually this is a bond where you discover that Hey whenever I read tarot cards this cat comes over and sits next to me and purs or whenever I'm at my altar my dog's right there paying attention almost like he's watching you know you can start to feel this energy between you and your companion and that's when witches will typically start to call their pet a familiar and what they really mean I think is Magical Friend magical assistant like a magical partner magical partner absolutely and I do believe as an animist I do believe that all of us have souls and Spirits animals trees Birds butterflies everything has a soul and a spirit and that energy can choose to work with you magically it's not technically what historically would have been called a familiar Spirit but it is what is a modern-day familiar or Magical Friend magical assistant and it's someone that you have some type of energetic bond with whether it's your dog your gecko your goldfish whatever you can still have a magical bond with that creature well in history that wasn't necessarily the definition of a familiar right A Familiar was a spirit that you called to you but it did come in quote unquote animal form rarely actually I've seen it like an animal type or maybe a combination of animals but they only take that form to perform a task it's a spirit and it'll take the form of an animal to go cause a problem or to go create Mischief or to disguise itself like I think even in Sabrina the Teenage Witch she calls a familiar and it comes to her more as like a demon or a goblin or an imp of some sort and then it turns into a cat and stays the cat most of the time in history your familiar is just a spirit and it will shapeshift into an animal or if it's a a demon or an imp a lot of times they'll take the form of an animal in order to carry out their deed yeah to do their dirty work that's not how they stay they don't stay in that form I feel like I saw that on a Star Trek episode once but know you'll see it in movies and things like that like even in um Shakespeare like um MC Beth the three witches they have familiars and they Spirits uh that are in animal form in particular it's an owl called harpier a toad called Paddock and a cat named galin but I believe those were demons that had taken animal form so it does happen like the Sabrina type familiar is more of a modernization now let me ask you this let's say you have a familiar is this like a one-on-one relationship or is like you're familiar hopping around town having relationships with with other people like I can't think of the right word to say it but like is this like a you belong to me I belong to you or you know what I'm trying to get at that really depends on what type of entity and what type of contract you have if say you're going the Sabrina route and you're just calling out for a familiar or for a magical companion the very next day a cat could show up for you you know the the cat distribution system will deliver a beautiful little cat to your door but that doesn't mean it's bonded to you for life though right right that that just means it's more than likely going to be your animal companion you'll see signs about it that'll lead you to a shelter or something and you'll find your your friend there but that's not really a contract you could ask for an actual spirit and do some high magic and and ask for a spirit to come and in that case depending on the type of spirit there's usually a contract involved in that and no they're not typically bouncing around you know doing things for other people that's typically yours you know your your familiar your the spirit that has come to you and is working with you specifically now you've mentioned the phrase contract a few times so I want to just real quick we did get what kind of sparked this episode is we did get a listener question and this would be a good time for the question are familiars summoned like demons and do you form a contract with them or are they like Spirit guides and they come to you when you need them most I think we answered that yes to both of those uh and the answer is definitely yes to both of those what's the deal with this contracts talk to me about contracts the contract thing is more that's not really my area I'm an animist witch I think everything's got free will and I would just ask them if they want to work with me but depending on the type of magic you do you can do some high magic you could get into cabala or get into some type of old biblical magic and those are contracts you you are usually working with demons or that type of energy and that does involve you setting the terms of the relationship this is what I expect from you and this is what I will give you and be specific folks because when you're not specific be careful what you wish for because you just might get it that's right that's not necessarily something that I do or necessarily believe in but other people do and that's their bad and that's cool while I do believe that there are spirits and entities that you could call to work with you like shell said tricky be specific you know cross your te's dot your eyes working with fairies man exactly and in different types of fairies depending on what you're working with depending on what type of energy you're talking to to be your familiar like like okay talk let's talk about in in European folklore a lot of times they they talk about like brownies in your house or or land whites and we're getting into a little bit of like genus loai but those were also familiars that people had they were creatures that people would talk to you know like the stories of like the brownies that would help the cobbler make his shoes right or that would come in and help the the Homemaker clean her house and take care of things and in return they were given food or they were given little clothes and it was a mutual relationship you can form Mutual relationships with these spirits and have them be your guides or your guardian spirits but it does have to be mutual it has to be a give and take be very careful of taking without giving because there are consequences again you know treat it like you're dealing with fairies man we should definitely do a fairy episode coming up because I know people have a lot of and there's a lot of overlap in these you know the genus lokai the familiar spirits and the Fay that that type of thing there's a lot of overlap here I think in modern day people more look at familiars as like animals that they have have connections with more so than than fairy type Spirits or brownie type Spirits I think it's more in modern times in the context of more so cats or owls or other other types of birds things like that you know what I mean people love to call their pets their familiars and sometimes your pet will be your magical companion I've had a cat that loved to be around when I would read tarot she wanted to touch the cards she wanted to be near the cards all the time and I felt like I got you know a little bit clearer reading sometimes when she was around so it can definitely be your pet but also I like how you mentioned Birds owls you're probably not going to have an owl as a pet well no but I'm just saying but the thing is is like sometimes you will see signs that say that owls or foxes or crows or some type of wild animal that you can't have as a pet is a guardian Spirit Well like always be outside your house or or what Happ yeah you'll you constantly turn on the news and there's owl stories you keep seeing owl references whenever you go anywhere and you know that it's not just coincidence it's meant for you in some way that can be owl Spirit reaching out to you that can be that energy of that creature that wants to give you a lesson or be a magical assistant to you in some way you know maybe every time you go to your ancestor altar crows come out your window or something you know and right so you'll know and and you'll know that feeling it's different than oh hey I see crows on my way to work every day because that's where they eat you know it's it's a different feeling than that when when it's a a magical sign for you and I've heard in familiar lore there's a couple different ways to get a familiar spirit and one of them is in time of need I know you've had a lot of cats show up to you when you needed a little Comfort I have I have and you know it happens sometimes that they just show up when you need them but sometimes you can call them and an interesting piece of familiar lore is some people believe that familiar spirits like the ancient folklore type of familiar Spirit has to be passed down from witch to witch and it's even said that a witch can't pass on until she gives her familiar Spirit to someone to inherit and only then can she cross the veil it is kind of funny how you say that that you know if if one goes one just seems to show up because you know as you recall my my Salem Kitty was a familiar like cat and after he parted this world we were pretty devastated I didn't realize how devastated I would be until I was that devastated and I was very adamant I was not going to get another cat I'm done I've had a cat for 20 years this was too painful over it and I just had one fall at my door and here we are I don't think this cat is a a familiar type cat but just the fact that almost like the universe knew I needed that space filled even though it might not be magically filled because you know my current cat he is anything but a familiar right but almost like the universe tried to fill part of that whole you know what I mean but I do think that magical pets magical friends do happen you know i' I've seen too many people and I've heard too many stories of people having assistance from their animals there's even I can't think of her name right now but there's a psychic that um has snakes and she gets actual messages from across the veil from her snakes as she's doing readings and that's an another really great benefit of having a familiar that's a the modern usage of familiar I guess a pet that's your magical companion because they do have a better sense of magical energies they can see ghosts spirits and energy centers better than we can oh absolutely you know so having them around can really assist you in your working so they might not be an actual familiar Spirit Tak an animal form they're just an animal but it's an animal with an energy that's uniquely tuned to magic or to you in some way and I think there's a lot of magic in that itself I always used to say you get a dog to to let you know when people are invading your home and you get a cat to let you know when people are invading your magical sphere yeah really for real some cat lure that I learned when I was a little kid is that if a cat is staring intently at absolutely nothing yes it is if you can get behind them and look between their ears you can see into the spirit world so you'll see whatever ghost or fairy they're looking at if you can look directly between their ears from behind them I was never able to get a cat to sit still long enough to test that theory but I still prettyy sure it's true when Salem used to hiss at a blank wall I was like all right something is up and my cat needs to handle this oh yeah cats can definitely see ghosts and fairies and Spirits cats and babies man cats and babies I think CU they're so close to being across that Veil anyways they regularly slink in and out of it all the time when my grandson was an infant when the baby and the cat would stare at the quarter of the ceiling I'd be like oh man come on time to break out the pine and the moon water man right would you advise people to maybe seek out a familiar or do you think it is a proceed with caution that's a loaded question um I would advise people not to try and make your pet your familiar that's what I advise because good answer one of the things that you're familiar is supposed to do one of the traditional things is they absorb negative energy that is being sent at you if there is any type of magical attack your familiar is directly in front of you ready to Bear the brunt of that negative your pet may not be able to handle that exactly you don't want to do that to Pho or to little Fifi you don't want to hurt them delicate man that's right that's right you know your little freret gets scared of loud noises you don't want to have them being directly there if somebody's shooting the evil eye your way because they're going to take the brunt of it but if you have a long-haired black cat then you get that cat on the casean because that kit will tear up I think if you are lucky enough to become the friend of a magical companion then I think that's awesome if you would like to call one into your life you can do that too these types of spells are super easy but as with anything in life proceed with caution when you getting into a contract yeah I wouldn't recommend getting into a contract with a familiar spirit I think it's probably nicer to work with the spirits of the land where you're at you know check with your house see if there's any household spirits that want to work with you kind of like the Sabrina witch where she asked for familiar and then it turned into a cat if you work with a familiar Spirit you can place a beautiful statue or something on your altar you know a pretty shell or something that reminds you of that energy and ask if it if that's an acceptable home for that Spirit right and sometimes they'll say yes and you can have that energy and meditate and work with that energy at any time on your altar and you could create a a separate space for it if you want to I know some people that work with spirits that put them into deity statues although deities are never familiars oh no no no no no no no no no no don't even ask rude but they'll put them in statues or they'll put them in in skulls or you know like the crystal skulls or the resin skulls I'm not talking real skulls although you but they'll put them in an object to put on their Altar and and work with the energy that way and that can be a fabulous way to to get the benefits without having to scoop litter and actually one thing that I have done is before Salem had passed away um we had got some clippings of his fur cuz he was a super ass long hair and I actually have like a little like a sachche bag that I keep those fur clippings and I have on my Altar and if you have a pet that you think is your magical companion you could certainly do rituals to thank them or to bless them you could meditate and call their energy into that meditation and see if they will talk to you or if they'll have some type of message for you in a in a meditative state but if you would like to call one into your life you know doing any type of calling spell and if it if you're asking for a cat use a little catnip if you're going to get a rat use a little cheese if you know that type of thing but tailor the spell whatever the calling is put a few things to actually lure what type of creature you're looking to be your magical companion into the spell it doesn't have to be anything harder than saying I wish for a magical companion that's also a gorgeous lired maincoon I'm there done that got it you just ask for it just ask for the universe to bring you what you want more than likely if you've ever heard of the cat distribution system you know it does not fail to deliver but it doesn't have to be a cat any type of animal can be a magical companion or a familiar so yeah if you're going to get into a contract with a spirit or a demon that's a different podcast if you're going to ask for a magical friend or a magical assistant to come be part of your life you can just ask for that energy and have it put into an in inanimate object or you can ask for it to come in four-legged finned furred scaled whatever just make sure that you're ready to take care of it in both the mundane and the Magical sense absolutely you know especially with cats like I said I had Sal them 20 years I mean this is this is a commitment this isn't just you know use it for your magical working and then off with you um as with any pet you need to take responsibility that's my PSA call me Bob Barker you know have your familiar spayed or neutered right but you know make sure you know what you're getting into it's kind of like buying the puppy at Christmas and then want to get rid of it by Valentine's Day you know if you call a familiar in make sure you're prepared to be responsible and be a responsible pet owner alternately if you call a spiritual familiar in make sure you're prepared and you're going to be responsible to be a spiritual pet owner that's right it's a contract historically they used to and I I think a lot of this is just you know bull crap that was used to kind of sub subjugate women for the most part but they used to say that the things witches would do to take care of their familiars were um you remember at the witch trials they would look for like an extra nipple or a witch's mole oh my God yeah they would say that that was how the witch would feed her familiar blood stuck from the teeth yeah exactly I don't want to be doing that can I tell you if my cat ever tried doing that I would have thrown it across the room now you animal lovers please don't bombard me with hateful comments but if a cat was trying to gnaw I'm a damn nipple okay you've crossed the line and we're done yeah that's definitely a line who who would have thought that that would have been okay you know I think some of this hysteria even went so far as to in Scotland and in in Europe back in the day I think if you even had a small animal in your house you could be called a witch like if someone saw a mouse or a rat or even a cat in your house they would use that to say that you were a witch so pretty scary stuff it's surpris it's surprising that we all have so many cats now and so many pets right well I think we have covered as best we can in a in an episode The ins and outs of familiars so if there's something you want to hear about something that you want us to talk about shoot us a message get us on
