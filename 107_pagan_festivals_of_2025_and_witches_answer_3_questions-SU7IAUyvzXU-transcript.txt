welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witches spoken word grimoire to witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where we walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your water in your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to it back on the broomstick I'm Layla and on this episode will be talking about two topics that are near and dear to my witty heart the upcoming Festival season and listener questions and I'm sure she'll and nothing really Sparks the summer off like a good Festival we're going to not only talk about some of the festivals that we love that we go to work shops app we're going to mention some that maybe your in your local area we know that is a very difficult for people to find witches in their area sometimes you go to your local metaphysical shop or maybe you go to the local union church but there's not always those things around either so finding festivals that are in your state or in your area that you can go to to be a wonderful way to meet a lot of other witches and pagans and also we're going to talk about some of the ones that we're going to be at if you want to meet us at some of these festivals  there's always more questions than we can get to but we randomly picked some and if we didn't get your question this time we will try to get to next time there's lots of ways that you can ask us you can send us DMS on Instagram you can send us emails you can also on Spotify you can send messages on each individual episode and on our hosting service buzzsprout they also have a way for people to send in questions but I can't respond to them so we actually went into that section and got some questions there to answer on here waiting area if you can't respond that makes zero sense it does and I asked them and they said it's so that you could answer them on air and I don't think they realize how many questions that we get it would be a lot easier to just type up a bus route going to start with some festivals including the one that we've been talking about an awful lot the upcoming Sacred Space conference in Townsend Maryland at the edge  end of March I've already started packing that's all I'm going to say tell and I went last year and we each did workshops on cannabis magic and tea magic and this year we were lucky enough to be invited back and we are doing a workshop together this time we're doing a meditation ritual this is actually going to be great and it's not just because it's just because we're doing it but we are actually going to do a ritual that is transformative going on a journey and you're going to meet your inner fool in this workshop and I'm excited to do it even working on this particular ritual workshop for 9 months 8 9 months now pretty seriously secret space conference has been going for several years and again they are in Towson Maryland and business considered a intermediate to Advanced practitioner conference and that's one of the things that I really enjoy  about it but don't get us wrong. That is not like a requirement you know the newbies obviously can participate in this but they are definitely kind of Next Level the kinda intense and so much information so much fun the people who put it on who hosted are just amazing wonderful witches this is an indoor conference and it's in a hotel it's a multi-day conference indoors and there's workshops all day long that you can go to fairy which the environment there's vendors musical performances rituals workshops but you also have to be cognizant you are also in a public hotel right there's more people than just our conference there that's one of the first ones in the year as the secret space conference but you know it doesn't end there festivals basically start around this time of year but then go out  Fruita fall so we do want to mention again not just the ones that were were participating in also to kind of Bounce to the middle of the country whose got the Austin witchfest this takes place in Austin Texas and it is a celebration dedicated to the education and practice of Witchcraft just like a Sacred Space there's workshops there's vendors there's rituals and it gives you an opportunity to learn and connect with fellow pagans in that area so for anybody in the Texas region check out Austin witchfest because that's going to be happening basically during the same time sacred spaces in May and this is one that sadly I haven't gone through yet and I don't know why because we know so many people that go to this particular basketball  pics of spring and this is in Western Massachusetts and it is it's an annual Gathering to celebrate the Earth they do workshops rituals music it's May 20th through 25th this year and they have it out in the woods basically but it's not like tent camping there's cabins they have communal cabins they have some smaller cabins some of them have here they all have showers there's a main building where they have food so you can buy like a meal plan for the week or you can bring your own food so it's all about community and being part of the community so you work together you go to workshops together I you do rituals you eat together that sounds super communal which I love really is this is more like our old Pagan community and it's funny because yeah which is how we actually heard about it we're going even though we haven't have now I believe this year it's $300 if you get a ticket early and then another 20  dollars if you get the full meal plan so it's not something I've ever really been able to swing in the budget but this year I'm I'm actually doing some side hustles man to try it really is and everything I've ever heard about it is that it's it's fantastic Community wonderful magic the workshops are just really really good now I want to go maybe this year maybe we'll see what is fantastic there's also the New York State ferry Festival that's in Sherman New York and that's the weekend of June 27th 28th and 29th this year while not technically a pagan Festival it is very Pagan and if you do get to Camp you'll be treated to all sorts of performances after hours Shenanigans and just a wonderful amazing group of witches pagans and very loving people of all kinds to the south of little bit this one this is another one  I've had an interest in for a couple of years and I'm just not been able to put it on my calendar yet Mystic South I don't know if you get time this isn't Atlanta Georgia and this kind of is more about mysticism paganism alternative spirituality again workshops rituals presentation this Earth Spirit this is intended to create that Community sense that just the title Mystic South kind of drawers me into want to go and they always have excellent presenters now I believe Mystic South is another one that's an indoor Hotel kind of thing as an indoor conference type of wine so you do you get a slightly different atmosphere what is indoors but I had a blast it was absolutely wonderful and the bed was much more comfortable indoor than it is  my go camping you know I just just a side note I remember one time that we were at a festival and we were camping and you know call it a microburst call it a tornado either way we thought we were going to die that night you know you don't get that at a hotel conference just saying it looks another bucket list Festival last year we did go to witches Fest USA which is in New York City New York this year it'll be a July 12th and it is a one day celebration that has workshops that has performances it was one street that was closed down that had boots and Tents set up along each side of the street and it was a lot of fun there are a lot of people this is a festival where we got recognized for the first time in the wild we were like wait they're talking about  you know maybe it's because I'm a New Yorker but you cannot have a bad time in New York City a bunch of witches and pagans kind of laid out on the street for the afternoon that's a vibe that you can't beat last year I was wearing a tank top and my loose flowy is pants and I still think I was a puddle of Sweat by the end of the day it was so hot and we still had an amazing time yeah yeah there was that but they had belly dancers in the street and they had musicians in the vendors top-notch by the way they have at Harper playing savage daughter she was great absolutely and then you know again awesome workshops you know that that just that sense of everybody that has a similar mindset that crowded into one small area  look for a little while now it's being held in Pomeroy Ohio and it has been for quite a few years the Wisteria Campground in Pomeroy Ohio and that is the Starwood Festival Starwood the year is July 15th through 21st so it does kind of overlap a little bit with some of Brushwood festivals so you'll have to pick and choose unfortunately but Starwood is another camping outdoor Festival bonfires rituals workshops amazing what you people know the next one I'm actually going to let you talk about it real quick because this is your job, but let's talk about the next two together it's at a place that is both of our Jam Western New York and Brushwood Center the first Festival is called the Sankofa Festival Sankofa to Sankofa symbol has long been Brushwood symbol it's there it looks like a a curlicue heart will put some pic  the idea of it is to not leave things undone or not to leave things behind to take care of things when you can explain to me when we first started going is that Sankofa we word from a tribe in Ghana in Africa and very powerful phrase that means to go back and get it the idea of it is that you should not forget the past that it's okay to go back for what you left behind you should remember your past in order to make progress in the future you have to remember the past you know take care of other things behind you 10 or 15 years ago they decided to have a festival and called it Sankofa and from their website they say that the Sankofa Festival is quote to celebrate the creative spirit and it's the weekend before serious Rising what kind of makes it fun is they set it up where it's almost like back-to-back festivals like the lead in shorter Festival to the Sirius Rising Festival that has been going  435 36 years now very large Festival serious Rising starting so that the minute senko Fighters over the next day starts the Sirius Rising Festival Festival you just want a weekend where you go and every day is going to have workshops is going to have performances there's a karaoke on Saturday night. In my opinion big bonfires and drumming in the round house every single night under the stars and then a larger bonfire at the end to celebrate the end of it of the festival a wonderful time and a lot of learning can be had in a lot of connection  and they also have some cabins and RVs that you could rent to stay another's are limited so you need to to sign up for those pretty quickly but you can camp you can RV camp you can also rent a cabin or an RV from them as well to say they also have hot showers now fresh was before Center is so once you go around the bend after you get down from the main buildings it is entirely clothing optional so you will see nudity in places and we've talked in the past about etiquette regarding clothing-optional Place definitely want to let you know that if you plan on going you going to see some Eddie Berry's you do not need to show your anybody's if you don't want to you can dress in your witchy finest you can dress them whatever you like or undress and whatever you like I think the takeaway is they do some bomb-ass festivals you know we used to go to Serious Rising every single year back in the day and like  it was like the highlight of my summer we ended up getting a seasonal campsite double seasonals out there every year because we love these festivals so much serious Rising is the bigger Festival that comes after Sankofa that is July 21st through 27th again at Brushwood folklore Center in Sherman New York now this one every day hey is dedicated to a different element so Monday is air Tuesday is fire Wednesday why don't you get the picture till on Saturday night they have the big huge end of Festival bonfire that is literally several stories tall to be a good Saturday at least 30 ft each of these days around a specific element and there's workshops performances and then  fabulous all night drum circles dancing there's a didgeridoo Dome it's just amazing it will blow your mind I don't know about you I did my first one and you did it with me there but I did my first Mandela there Catherine Cartwright Jones we used to work with ccj John all the henna and some of the workshops are to work with the round house which is it's an open-air structure that's built of a lot of Beltane bowls shelter on one side and it's dirt floor and in the center is usually a large bonfire every night and sometimes we would break the sand around the bonfire and draw a labret Mandela's and designs to dance into the dirt later that night as we celebrated each element everyday  all night long to watch the game at both of them as well and hopefully I am hoping to be presenting as well so yeah there's that but we'll see we haven't heard back yet most Colorado and that's July 30th to August 3rd this year and we did get to talk to the wonderful people from Dragon fest last year you can check out that episode out link it in the show description but that is also another fantastic outdoor very wonderful witchy Festival sadly we have not yet gone to just makes me want to go but just say I love, Colorado so magical do I live there for a little while in Leadville Colorado actually it just feels magical until Monday so  Temple Fest this is actually a little closer to to where I'm at this is going to be in Carlton Massachusetts this is end of August like a Labor Day weekend this again you know celebrating Pagan and Witchcraft traditions this they do a lot of community building and you know the same thing as rituals workshops presentation this year so I will be at Temple Fest Leila will be with me I am there in a support capacity but I will be there enjoying time with us as well so hopefully you guys can come see if you are in the western Mass or Eastern New York Region or any surrounding area get your booty to Temple fast because this is going to be a good time  we don't know the layout on this one yet whether they have cabins or tents you know anything about it so I do know that there is cabin options I am still looking into accommodations because I just recently found out I was accepted so I'll have to get back to you on that this next one is a one-day festival and it's getting more and more popular every year and you'll see these crop up especially in bigger cities usually the end of August through September and I'm talking about pagan Pride Day last year we had wonderful fun and joy of presenting at the central New York Pagan Pride cuz we got accepted for that back when I lived in New York neither of us live in New York this year so we're thinking about maybe we'll meet up cuz kind of central to us so maybe we'll try that again or maybe we'll find a different Pagan Pride this year or not sure yet fabulous people in central New York and that was such a  will experience going back to our charms episode I still have all the acorns I pocketed that day because their local you're going to meet people for the most part that are local to you yeah least within a few hours again most major cities will have them nowadays the very first Pagan Pride day that shall and I went to was shortly after the 9/11 attacks actually it was in 2001 I still have some pretty crazy pictures from that but we had planned to go and visit our friend who lived in New York City who was part of our cabin and that was a sobering experience it was kind of a strange introduction to pay but yeah it's pretty it's pretty deep but Pagan Prides are growing every year and I just think it's wonderful that they're back  was New York City New York City and in we were three hours or every major city has won New York I think I just wanted if the New York state has a ton of them here in Pennsylvania I've seen him in Harrisburg Philly they're all over and you should be able to find something local in your area or go to what does it mean to 3 hour radius of you cuz they literally are everywhere now and like you said it's called Pagan pride and different groups in different cities I don't want to say there's not a designated date on a calendar but it's almost like some time within that month almost like September itself is like Pagan pride month so they're going to be  exactly most of the ones I see are very late August through September if for nothing else network with your local witches people from a land that you love there is one out in California that we have on our list this is called hexenfest and this is October 9th through 12th and it's in Upper Lake California this is Music and Arts Festival for witchy creative and Visionary types they explore seems like otherworldly and a Mystic Mystic Pagan Fairy Tail and they provide a space for inspiration and community that they like it like that entwine music with it I like that honestly most of the ones that we've ever been to will have flamingos have different musical acts  China promotes music is part of it when the rule is a name you probably know and she is playing on Hexum fast on Saturday night so if that gives you an idea interesting I don't know how quickly I can get to California. Yeah we're going to wrap up in this is I like to think of this Festival is a part 2 so we talked about Earth Spirit in western Mass earlier in the spring they also in the fall have a festival called Twilight governing this is the one I have to go to know I'm confused and you may know more and you can correct me but do you have to go to Rites of Spring to be able to go to Twilight coveting suggested idea is that you should really  how to write the spring first because the idea is Twilight is intense it's three days of intense magic this was deep deep this is probably the deepest spiritual one out of all of them like immersive spiritual magical work and you go there not to party with can be a very strong but I'm through a lot of these special but you go there to do the work and so it was suggested that you go to Rites of Spring first before you went to Twilight company now that's not necessary although its preferred but not necessary at all the cool thing about Twilight coveting is that they have plans when you sign up you don't just sign up to go and then you just say oh at these different workshops every day you sign up for a specific Clan  and each Clan will be like the spider Clan or the grandmother claimed I got into a house kind of like it'll be different at different levels of magic or maybe I'll be more for beginners or more for you know people who are into meditating each one will have a different focus and so you pick what you want to focus on magically and your request to be in one of three Clans should I love that yeah and so you won't know what Clan you get until after everybody is signed up then they go to Earth Spirit the community goes through and tries to balance all these plans so then you'll find out which of the three you chose you actually got into my God I love that every year I look at these plans and I'm just like I want to do this so bad. Called again  it has been on my bucket list for far too long and I really really want to call this year so bad this is the one this is the one that's really deep apologize that we didn't focus a whole ton on Midwest and Western ones they're hard to find an inn where so unfamiliar but go to the website mandragora Magicka and they have listings of festivals on their Layla and I have a list and I am sure I can coax Layla into putting it in the show notes exactly but I just think if for nothing else the networking opportunities and you know if you have one local to you and you're you're afraid to commit to a weekend or a week-long get a day pass go check it out and see if it if that's interested in  Syrian sweater there in hotels Conference Centers in the middle of the woods I recommend everybody go to a festival at least once as many as you can but the kind of freaked out the fun parts of a few go to Sacred Space or Temple fast or Sankofa or serious Rising you are going to have a late lunch so I think that is our list now that is not a comprehensive list there are a lot more festivals times that we didn't get time to mention I will put a link to your mandragora Magica as well as all the festivals that we've listed okay now the other thing that I absolutely love other than festivals is talking and we have a grab bag of question question question I'm sorry I don't have your name but this person wrote in I was wondering if there was some spell work or information on witchcraft for those for recovery  from PTSD and things like that what can we do to move on and he'll meditate would probably be my first thing to be honest with you try to find a meditation you know for me personally I was go back to that Crystal countdown meditation but find a meditation that works for you that you can do whether the daily every other day we find one and stick with that one meditation and do it repetitively for a lot of people trauma it can really leave you feeling not connected to yourself physically not connected to your physical body and so doing breathwork doing meditation can really help to slow you down and help you to find comfort and in that connection again and it can kind of help you get out of that stress mode that fight or flight mode and also a daily  Cactus finding a daily practice that you can lean into whether a stop meditation or tarot card fault or brewing a special cup of tea you know every day with intention to try and bring yourself back to a peaceful moment and be something that you can really do I guess the bottom line is if not me but 5 to 10 minutes a day or you can just kind of become one with yourself and if you can find some time to do some spell work and create an incense incense blend that I like for relaxation chamomile Lavender Blue Lotus and frankincense you can mix those together with intention and then use a little bit of that as it's Bailey incensed when you're doing this practice especially if you can be in a peaceful State when you create that incense that will carry over that every time you burn that incense it will help to bring you back to that peaceful state that centered state that can help you find a little bit of normal  be in peace in the middle of that stress and I think that's where the repetitiveness comes in is it kind of gives you a focal point for the future when you know when you find yourself starting to Spiro default to that specific thing and out of repetitiveness it automatically down in a calming space with incense and candle light that just the act of pulling them in kind of bring me back to that relaxation State Journal whoever wrote this or to anyone else that's in our audience is suffering with PTSD or anxiety or stress especially nowadays we get it just know that we hear you and know that healing doesn't always look the same for everybody it's not always a straight line some days are going to be easier than others but magic and witchcraft  is at its deepest form about reclaiming who you are about being who you are feeling about healing yourself but know that you're on the path know that we're here with you know some days we feel the same way in your podcast every episode leaves me with new insight and questions to be respectful of your time I'll ask about the swords versus Juan's representations your episode discussing this controversy was very helpful and validating I'm struggling because it isn't a 14-1 switch for me it's close but not complete is there a method of learning Terrell in this situation is it a good idea to further explore with wands and swords each means to me I can't help but feel discomfort at losing something from a card if I recreate meaning of these two suits and how does this affect my understanding of how these cars  the elements directions and astrology each of those are big questions thank you for sharing all that you do warmly Dawn from Rhode Island John also says that she lives on Seneca lake in ha no shit yeah so hey it's on I also grew up on Seneca Lake how fun hey Don I grew up about an hour from Seneca Lake first I think the first reaction I have to the first question is your cards are going to do you the best Justice in your relationship with your cards in the messages you received from the cards are going to be best with what you feel and just because the book says whatever who gives a shit if you feel that swords means are that's what you're going to get out of those cards so we don't want you to feel uncomfortable with you know how you feel versus what the books or that the the pamphlet says  for those cards to do their Justice to you and your intentions you have to go with what you feel those meetings are for swords and and and Wands and say that if you don't feel like that it has any Elemental correspondence that's okay too if you're not comfortable those and they don't seem to suit you or how you read or your cards just throw him out don't even use those how do swords feel for you like do they feel strong do they feel angry do they feel passionate do they feel intellectual do they feel like conversation like what do they feel like to you and that's where we're daily Paul's and journaling come and see him because if you write down how it presents itself to you what feelings that gives you you can just go with that you don't need to assign an element to it at all actually I'm going to have to agree with Taro journaling it kills me to say it but I totally agree with it but my relationship with a different than Layla's relationship  the cards that's going to be different than Don's relationship with the cards so you just need to spend time with your cards and in build that relationship and learn what cards are saying what yeah and there's definitely days when I'm reading your car don't like the fire energy is just bouncing off his car and his other days when I read the same card and never think of an element or fire or anything like that at all so it is really going to very on the situation and kind of what's going on in your life and in that particular reading exactly so now the next one I think is really funny because you mentioned this in the first question but alright Aloha from Maui Hawaii I'm so happy to have found your show and I'm really enjoying listening to it I started way back at the beginning and I'm listening through I haven't finished all the episodes those forgive me if you already covered this but on your recommendation I am reading  power of the witch and I'm really enjoying it but I'm having a little trouble with the crystal countdown I'm not exactly sure what she means by seeing the numbers and seeing the Apple are you supposed to literally see it behind your clothes eyes like a hologram or is it more imagining in your mind and holding the image in your mind by you think you could do an episode if you haven't already where you really break down the crystal countdown in a different meditation she talks about in the book like the Apple meditation and visit you store meditation thanks again for this great podcast I'm really enjoying your first of all if and only if you let Layla and I come stay with you in Hawaii  that's right we are absolutely not going to answer it unless we get an invitation to the first question is absolutely yes I picture in my mind's eye an apple with the number on the Apple yes and I'm going to say absolutely no I can't see things in my mind like that really yeah it's so okay alright so I have a thing people have a thing okay some people can in their mind in their minds I have vivid detailed mental pictures they can literally see a picture in their head some people can go so far as to see like a movie in their head moving images in their head and then there's other people like me who have trouble with that and there's actually a thing called aphantasia where there are people who cannot see images at all in their head  I can't I can't and I love meditation so some people are very surprised to find out that I don't see images in my head like that I can't see pictures I never knew that is not funny I didn't realize that other people could do everything is right nothing is wrong kind of yeah but what I do instead when when people talk to me about visualization and the fact that I don't actually see a picture comes up what I realized that I do is it's more of a it's a feeling it's an energy if I'm doing the crystal countdown and I say I imagine like the number nine in your head and say that his friend and my clothes. I think about 9 I think about what it looks like I can't see it but I can think about drawing it or I can think about what it looks like in the real world I can think about what 9 means me and I can think about the colors kind of like symbolic thinking it can be  so you don't actually have to be able to see a picture to do magic or to do meditation and that's what a lot of people like me who have a Fantasia to differing degrees have trouble with sometimes when they hear about spell word for meditation because we don't see pictures and that can be a barrier for some people but symbolic visualization is just as valid and works just as well interesting I didn't know that was a thing where is mine's more like Sesame Street and I see now that I also have face blindness that goes with it which is a little difficult for me I have a very everybody's face looks the same and I can't remember what anybody looks like unless I know you glad you remember I've known you for decades I know your face as well as I know my own good keep it that way but yeah so are wonderful Hawaii listener Aloha but yeah so I love that you're enjoying power of the witch it's a  I love the crystal countdown meditation fantastic don't worry about not being able to actually see them work on the sensation of 9 I guess work on the heels or think about it the more makes you feel how do you feel when you think of bright yellow what are the sensations about it I am not exactly sure how to describe how I quote unquote visualize things but it's kind of like that we would love to do an episode in the future where we talked about the crystal countdown meditation in particular and in-depth and we'll talk about all sorts of different ways to to use that in your practice absolutely vital stuff Hawaii there you go see we answered a question now you owe us  I think that was the rules I'm pretty sure that was the ripples exactly at least for her it is that's right there you go it's it it's finding now but hopefully we will see some of you guys at upcoming festivals including a secret space coming up the end of this month we've already had a couple people reach out and say that they would like to stop by and say hi so I'm very excited to meet some listeners you know I think this was the funnest part is when we actually get to meet less nervous and I guess last year at festivals I was taken aback but I I just want people to know that we love meeting you as much as you love meeting us and you already have permission to give us big hugs come on now say hi where they're flagging sound from across the conference room where into it will say hi to lutely all right I got a pack I got to go we have got to go pack we're so excited about all of this we have so much stuff I have so many books that I want to get to sign you know  great lineup this year and I just I'm flabbergasted and I'm honored to be able for us to do this with the lineup that's there I can't wait I'm not sure 5 to get us in there but keep doing what I do know is if I don't go pack I ain't going anywhere thank you all so much for listening to this episode of please like subscribe give us some Stars give us some reviews we love it and it helps to show out send us an email at back on the broomstick at gmail.com send us something in the snail mail back on the broomstick PO Box 106 Salem Massachusetts 01790 I love getting mail I just want to say that if not we will see you next week on our next episode in the meantime be wise be Wicked and you know what folks Cupid witchy
