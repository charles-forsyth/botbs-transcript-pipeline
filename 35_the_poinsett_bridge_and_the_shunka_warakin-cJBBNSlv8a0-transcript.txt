okay and all right future me will put this at the beginning I like future me future you is probably way more sober probably probably just saying all right it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft it's 4:20 a.m. do you know where your weed is at I smok it welcome to episode 35 of the stoned Witches Hour today's podcast will thrill your ears with two of the creepiest ghost and crypted stories that can be found from right here in the United States of America where Poltergeist and politics will scare the stoned right out of you representing all things weird weedy and witchy on the west coast I'm Leila wow I'm so high that you're in scared me I'm so yikes I I I'm apparently Scaredy Pants shell and we haven't even started yet but I still ATT test to I'm from the East Coast which is the ghosty Coast nice yeah I I would say you're probably pretty right although the last couple weeks I've been trying to catch right up with you on the coast with the ghosty most you know I will say last week I really think that we were 5050 dead on equal we we were scary last week we were we had some pretty good scary stories and this week like I said I have a crypted tale I can't even believe it because I'm the one who always does the Cryptids and I can't even believe that I've got you doing a crypted story you're hooked you're hooked I know you are I am you got me you absolutely called it because it's been a while it's been a minute shell since you told a crypted story and you know how much I love your creepy crypted stories I felt like I did like four crypted stories in a row so I tried to back off a little bit so I am actually so thrilled that you are actually doing one so please tell me what crypted am I going to find on the west coast so in today's episode I am going to be doing a crypted from Montana and we stayed kind of in the canine crypted family with something called the shunka ween oo I'm intrigued and now Montana that's like up in the almost Canada region so this has to be like some snowy loving meat eating oh my God don't tell me it's a meat eater I don't even oh it definitely is oh you don't even want to know how many animals it's killed but we'll get into it so yeah I'm gonna go a little bit different you know I love these little weird cute historical East coasty things you do love your little historically things so I am going to take it back to a bridge because if you recall I've kind of been on a bridge lately I don't know what it is about bridges they're so cute I love them you have you do you get in like a little cycle of things and bridges seem to be the current cycle I love it don't get me wrong love me a good haunted bridge keep going you know what I think it is I think that my boyfriend and I have done a lot of driving this summer and I've seen a lot of bridges I've seen some covered bridges and some scaredy Bridges so I just I don't know I got in a bridge thing I am going to take and you know every it seems like everything we do it's like in my area everybody has the most world's famous roast beef I feel like I I've got the most haunted bridge again the most haunted everything haunted everything and you know you know what the best thing is not only have I had a lot of fun doing this with you but I am learning so much about so many haunted places that I may not have Otherwise Known and unfortunately it is creating a long list of places I want to go and [ __ ] around and find out with a Ouija board same oh I am absolutely having a ball doing this with you shelle I'm so glad that we are continuing to do it as much as it kills me to admit it I am actually learning that the west coast is kind of ghosty we're very ghosty I'm learning so much stuff I it's amazing the things that you know you think you hear bits and pieces of but you don't really know until you kind of di into it some of them I mean we love the ghosty paranormally part but some of them kind of turn into a partial history lesson which I personally think is cool it's very fun and like I said I'm trying to find even deeper places that I've never heard of before because this is so just enlightening and interesting and I feel like is there any place left in America that's not haunted I haven't found one yet if I throw a dart someplace I can just pretty much find something there there's some local Legend there's some creepy house or strange Cemetery or or a crypted or some crypted or Folk floor everywhere the whole USA is covered in creepiness I'm just finding so many cool places this this podcast is just opened up so many haunted paranormal locations I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it too I love it I love it I'm so glad we are doing this together so much fun it is so much fun and you know I think that we need to be like we need to be like the two old ladies on Practical Magic except we need to live in an RV and travel America doing like ghost Huds oh we'll have our little Nomad RV all deck out in velvets and you know our light and stars but be like the ants on Practical Magic be like traveling we'll be the traveling ants we'll be the traveling practical met can I be sigy Weaver um I just want to be stalker chanting that's all I got to say did I say sigy Weaver I don't think that's who you meant but that's okay that's not who I meant I mster J damn it that means you got her first I do love Sig okay can I be siger Weaver as an ant how about this you can be whoever you want as long as we live in an RV in Travel America looking for ghosts I'll be I'll be witchy Leela yes yes yes so you know I just think this is amazing and of course being high talking about it in researching these places is also very fun oh so much fun I mean I also feel like I'm learning a lot about American history through this believe it or not surprisingly I I had no idea that you could approach history from a paranormal bent and learn as much as I have you know if they would have told me that in 10th grade history it like you know listen you just learn all this stuff and we'll tell you the ghosty part of it for your regions exams they would not have had to argue with me I would have been like yes let's do this geography history government World Wars all of this stuff I would have absorbed it so so much better if you had told it through a paranormal metaphysical ghosty creepy lens if there's any Educators out there please we're telling you try it at least for the month of October what's what's the worst thing that could happen it doesn't work okay a lot of stuff you do doesn't work just saying I bet you if you did a haunted history for October that would be the facts yeah those would be the facts the kids would retain the entire year right shell and Ila we have patented this uh Learning System it's the scar the pants off the kids system and it's history while teaching them history and geography it's going to go worldwide or at least USA wide just remember we were the ones who came up with the idea we we're patting patting P patenting it oh boy I'm smoking some rainbow runs tonight and I can't tell stalker Channing from signey Weaver I can't say patented but you are coming up with an education genius idea I'm so smart I feel so intelligent this evening I do you know I do too and I'm still smoking the same thing I feel like it's hitting me different this time I've said this about a couple weeds lately I think it's your mindset that either makes it like a I don't want to say an upper or downer but I think your mindset can either make you productive or melt to the couch and I think maybe the last time I smoked this I was feeling very kind of melty in the couch and this time smoking it I'm kind of a little more upbeat and and ready to get down with the ghosties nice I like I said I'm smoking some rainbow runs and I again wanted to go with something a little different these look very Crystal because all I'm thinking when you say rainbow runs I'm thinking candy I'm thinking Skittles I'm thinking runs tell me about the flavor I'm curious the flavor is really good not as sweet as the tropical Tropicana Cherry I had last week but still has a really nice smoke very I guess sweet is a good way to put it I would say it's not as Cherry sweet or Berry Sweet like the cherries tasted but it is like a easy to smoke kind of mellow sweet tasting to it do you grind this up or are you a stuffing packing with this this is too resiny and too thick I mean when you break it up it is definitely kind of purpley in there and they're very thick dense buds so you have to break it up or you're my husb hb's a stuff and shover and unfortunately I'm kind yeah but it doesn't burn very well so I find myself pulling the nug out and breaking it up and putting it back in that's actually been that's been happening to me a lot lately it's almost like everything I've been getting I mean you could go back a few episodes of me talking about this I feel like it's been like two months that everything I'm getting almost has to be ground up to kind of be smokable stuffing packet it's like you're trying to smoke a damn Rock no I'm consistent happy Valley love them um I just thought they might have changed up something with their grow system that things were coming out more dense and less fluffy because when you feel them they actually feel dense as opposed to that like kind of light fluffy weed so I just thought that can you do something in your growing method to make things more dense or absolutely yes you can get better genetics you can you can focus on uh cultivars that have that denseness that rich THC that rich resiny dense bud and just focus on growing those particular types of cultivars you can also like the better light and lights are getting better and better all the time they are miles away from The High Press sodiums I used to grow with you know now they're all LEDs different types of dodes and and it's even getting better than LEDs I can't even go into the lights or would be here for hours and hours and hours but they're probably using much better lights more light you know then once you start adding lights into the system then you can start adding CO2 which can help add a lot of density to the buds if they've got a really nice growth system so I think as we know more about how to grow and as legal states and legal Growers are setting up their their whole it's competitive it's very competitive around here it's almost like every store chain does their own grow so like you've got to be you've got to be better than the rest because there's so many options around here and you know I I as we talk about I have no shame I go to Happy Valley because honestly I feel not only do they have the best weed as far as quality selection price but it's consistent and and and the competition is so big I I I can just totally imagine people have to hone in their growing methods to keep competitive to keep people going to their store as opposed to another store and you you H it right there customer satisfaction and coming back is really the key here I mean if you're paying $608 the tax better be included in that damn $60 for all you sellers out there and it better be [ __ ] fire I'm not going to smoke swag for $450 an ounce or something what's a what's six times eight I'm too high for math you crazy fool no$ 480 $480 an ounce you know practically a $500 ounce I am not going to smoke that if it's [ __ ] right absolutely absolutely and and so I just think that I just turned it you know chocked it up to competition I just never you're right I didn't think growth hormones could play a part I think for the most part particularly in legal states it's not something you have to really worry about but again the more I know people that say the more dense it is the the the possibility is there but anyway I do think in this particular case it's it's like you said it's competition it's it's these places that are getting better at growing they're adding more lights they're adding you know more things to optimize the the flavor the denseness and the tries of these plants with these places being in a retail business at the scale they are you you can't tell me they're not up on the latest and greatest everything and the minute something is better they're getting it and and and installing it and trying it out you know um and I I love that I mean I that's what I'm doing at home is whatever I can afford to make these the best plants that I absolutely can and that usually means adding more light yeah so you know like you said you know newer lights are coming out things are just technology is making weed great it's wonderful legalization has been fabulous for this I'm so happy yeah well you know we're still not there yet L we not forget we we haven't hit the hurdle of federal yet but I think we're closer than we've ever been I agree I think so I hope so and you know these rainbow runs are hitting so good I practically feel like I'm melting it's a good 29% THC and I am more than happy to delve into some stories and get all spooky with you today so I'm going to talk about a haunted bridge in South Carolina I also have a thing with South Carolina right now we're gonna talk about the poinet bridge poinet like poin seta like the plant kind of but without the a at the end p o i n s e TT poin set poin set bridge and actually you know you had talked about in a previous episode how you thought things were kind of attached to like Stone type stuff yeah this is actually a stone bridge oh fun okay another one for the stone Theory I'm down so we're that's that's what I'm GNA talk about it's it's only really a 14 foot long bridge but it is the oldest bridge in South Carolina oh how neat so is this a walking bridge or a driving Bridge well not that I've been over it it seems like it is a walking bridge I think it was originally built as like a road bridge back in like the horse and carriage it was built in 1820 so as you can imagine this was probably like horse and carriage type type horseback riding type Transportation this wasn't how fun and romantic to hear the horse and the wooden Carriage wheels just kind of like clip clapping along the stone bridge so it was built as a road but as you can imagine like it's not this isn't something that is anything modernday used okay it at this point it's like kind of a dirt walking bridge I guess is the modern day explanation so this was actually also put on the national register of historic places in 1970 because it's it's one of the the first stone structure Bridges it's hard to explain but the archway of the bridge looks almost like a church Arch oh how neat okay and it's the oldest bridge in the state it's the oldest bridge in the state but like if you were to look at it like sideways it would almost look like a a stone doorway into a stone Castle okay all right from a magical perspective to turn a bridge which is already kind of you know got like that Two Worlds kind of thing going on to turn a bridge into a doorway and a doorway that looks like a church that's holy for part of the population that's just asking to be a portal to something one one description of it is that it's a that the bridge is a Charming centerpiece to a local park with its Gothic stone walls like something out of a fairy tale oh damn I want to go take pictures there not just because it's probably crawling with orbs but because it sounds gorgeous but then it's followed up so I so so that that was a very beautiful phrase I said Gothic stone walls like something out of a fairy tale yeah the next statement is a Grim's brother fairy tale oh my favorite kind they usually have some sort of [ __ ] up twist at the end now like I said this is supposed to be quote unquote the most haunted bridge in South Carolina and apparently the minute it gets dark it is a hot of activity oh now for all of our viewers out there this is definitely something worth Googling oh wow can you see that that literally looks like a portal but do you see how the creek kind of winds through the underneath doesn't that spell does that spells like magic it does it's a beautiful stone bridge with like this gorgeous pointed arch with a stream running through it and the forest on the other side that is stunningly beautiful and creepy all at the same time it makes you want to go there but it also like make I want to go there going there get pictures of the orbs all inside that Archway I don't know if I would walk through it on a full moon night though I'm afraid that if I walk through it the other side is going to be very different than what it appears yeah yeah there's got to be certain times of the year where where when you walk through that you're going to come out somewhere else on the other side it absolutely looks that way now here's the thing they say if you consider walking through the arch at Night Don't yeah because they're smart we called that [ __ ] of course they built it that way what were they thinking they say that at nightfall there's mysterious screams and murmurs flashing lights I want to camp there can you camp nearby this is a weird thing now tell me if you've ever heard of something like this some people do think it's a portal and that the flashing lights are actually perhaps Morse code coming from the other side well if it's more code people could like figure it out yeah that's what I think and I never found like what they thought it was so I don't know some sort of code how creepy cars I guess if you approach it cars all of a sudden will like stall out and not start anymore electrical trouble people think that they feel like a ghost is physically pulling them away from the bridge like they're being gra no no don't touch me e e don't touch me um you know as as you and I both know some of the most beautiful places have the darkest Secrets they do it's so true and this one really seems to I mean it seems like it was built to be some sort of portal to another world it does but you know there's also people that think that this is a bunch of crap this is uh outside of this is near uh Greenville South Carolina now this was built i' never figured out why it was built it might have just been for a road but there were people that were charged to build this bridge and as you can imagine back in the early 1800's bridge building not the safest of occupations yeah and that's a lot of stone that's not just a little bit of stone that's a lot of stone now of course there had been people who died along the way oh now some people were buried near the bridge okay so they died one way or another during construction and they were taken a few feet away and just buried right oh [ __ ] the lazy bastards they couldn't even bother to take them away and bury them someone else they had to bury them right near where they were working [ __ ] you don't even know this you know what they did with some of them what freaking buried them inside the bridge no tell me you are joking that's got to no that's got to be an exaggeration basically started freaking just putting the stones around him and just keeping on like we'll build around you oh my God no why where have they done that before like Hoover Dam isn't there like bodies in Hoover Dam or something what is within toming people in like concrete stone type like did they really love the job that much that they want to remain there for eternity I don't think so that's like a dick move man really for real I don't want to walk over them their dead body all the time such a dick move but yeah so so there are people that are buried around it on like around it but then there's people that have been encapsulated in the stone in the bridge itself so there's the start of your hauntings and activities now keep in mind back to your stone Theory so not only do you feel that there's some connection between ghosties and paranormal and stone type I do but then you're going to put these bodies in the stone yeah you're just asking for trouble everything they did from the design the material to the entombing of bodies has turned this into a bad place a not good spot you know what sucks about this the most it is such a gorgeous location such location but again at night downhill all downhill from there it completely haunts out it just completely ghouls out and of course you know it's popular from locals and visitors People Like Us who would drive all the way to just to see it I'm so there it's on the L I'm writing it on it's on the list but several locals say that again um like I said unable to start their car when they've gone and visited and are ready to leave a light has said to move towards them while they sit in their car The closer the light gets they start hearing a loud scream and it gets louder so as the light gets closer The Scream gets louder oh that's creepy orbs everywhere you'd freaking love it yeah oh yeah I knew it I knew they'd be there the screams in the light seem to be the most common experiences but people hear voices coming from the arch um screams from a top of the bridge of course as you can imagine a bridge like that people have tried to plumet to their death so you know there's been suicides there as well places like that attract a lot of Darkness people have seen green green lighted dots floating almost similar to a lantern I've never like I've seen different color orbs and all of that but they are specifically saying these as greenlighted Dots greenlighted Dots my first thought's aliens but right so like alien orbs others say that they feel like like a how do I explain it like a fear instilling presence like some sort of some sort of terrifying entity energy like right there just like makes them scared they they've actually we there was a couple that went there that felt they got to it and had this like paralyzed feeling paralyzed with fear a lot of people say whatever is there like instills fear you know what I mean yeah wow now if if you buried my body in stone I'd probably want to instill fear in you too but it's probably just those poor guys like the just the torment of their souls being trapped at work forever there was this man named Lu Evans I think I'm saying that right I might not be saying that name right but he he said his uncle saw white figures out there at night kind of reminiscent of the lady in white but hauntings like are just synonymous with that bridge they've actually done a YouTube minseries called Haunted Echoes South Carolina and there's been a book written ghosts of upstate South Carolina that kind of go into super great detail but even you know even as is early I say early I mean is most recent is uh 2018 there was a professional ghost hunting folks there um they took 400 photos around the bridge and nearly a hundred of those photos exhibited some type of phenomenon wow they also did EMF stuff speaking of stuff that you are looking for for my little collection your collection they said the EMF activity appeared to move about the area it was never necessarily in the same place it seemed like something was walking around them a good portion of the time while they were standing on the bridge so even though they'd go all around it was almost like that energy was kind of swirling around them right it was like staying nearby but not getting too close right so it's not that you know it necessarily like it happened during a specific you know it wasn't like a war time thing or like a Indian burial grave typ I think they just built it and then the the entities came because they built it to be some sort of portal whether they meant to or not well and also um during the time it was built um I I guess apparently there was also um some slaves that were killed there oh no so I mean you figure there was some murders there um as far as if nothing else the slaves being being being killed there um there were workers that died while they were working that were either buried there and imagine being buried at the workplace like that's awful that's like the biggest [ __ ] you oh I'm going to bury you at work well thank you can you imagine having to continue on working being like oh well there's Bob he's you know five feet behind me never going to leave again you know I touched on hooverdam about how bodies were were buried there and there's been other places that that Bridges and stuff that bodies were left in the concrete you don't put a body within the structure of a bridge unless you're trying to hide it so that makes me think who was murdered there why are you hiding a body in a bridge why right why would you bury it Inge is gonna make you take Billy Bob and put him in the ground five feet from the bridge but you're GNA take John Smith and put him in the bridge so I feel like even though I can't find any evidence of it there had to have been some foul play as far as the folks that are within the bridge itself because what would motivate you to bury some of them outside and some of them inside yeah that seems so weird and I I I'm not 100% sure on the bodies in the Hoover Dam thing I don't know if that's an urban legend or not but like why would you why would you bury people there like that just is terrible but if you hear screaming there that LE that also leads me down the rabbit hole is are those screams of people that were buried in the bridge alive just were they like cranky coworkers did they bury the one that annoyed them in the bridge or did that guy really die like why would you bury your coworker in the bridge I just don't get it right like why are you sitting there and putting half these people in the bridge and half these people in the ground and where the screams coming from like there's Foul Play Even though I can't find evidence of it I have this strong feeling of Foul Play with some of these deaths I think we need to do a seance there and ask them what was going on what really happened to them and I think we need to dig deeper because someone up high knew what they were building someone knew that the shape of this bridge and that all these maybe they orchestr yeah it's like like a gateway to a thing like a real gateway to Hell well I was just gonna say out of all the portal to Hells they claim like this one looks like could have been built maybe they built it to be a portal and then maybe they had all those people killed on purpose to like charge the portal or maybe they were sacrifices for it to some [ __ ] like where is the screaming from if if if you weren't just doing some foul play man right exactly exactly I think this is a mystery this you know and and and I just picked this place and what I found the most frustrating about this particular story I am walking away with way more questions than I have answers same and I I can't wait to get there and take pictures way more questions than I have answers and you know it it looks like it actually reminds me when I was looking at some of the pictures now I only showed you one of the pictures but doesn't it remind you of the place where where our community used to gather and do ritual yes it does other other than the bridge but yeah other than the bridge but like that I I just oh yeah very much so something about those pictures that I feel go there like I feel drawn to go there because I feel like there's so many unanswered questions and that anything I found I feel only scratches the surface of what's really going on at this bridge like what is really going on at this bridge I agree I don't feel like I have found out I feel like I found out bits and pieces I think the only way we're gonna find out is if we go take a lot of orb photos there take a Ouija board of course Ouija board got to ask a few questions absolutely so camera Ouija board check definitely in my bag of ghost hunting tricks yeah yeah and I I definitely think this is yet again um a bucketless location truly oh I agree I absolutely agree that sounds like a creepy beautiful place to go it looks like a really cool place to Camp because at night is when you're going to probably get the best EVPs and the best orb photos well they say that it's a gorgeous place during the day and it's like the whole location personality changes come dark that's true oh I bet you know I just I just really wish I could have found so much more about this place because like I said I just feel like I just scratched the surface on this and and maybe it hasn't been investigated enough maybe there's just not enough online about it but I am so intrigued by this one and I haven't been able to say that in a while honestly it sounds like a really fun creepy place I want to go I know I know so if anybody has been to South Carolina and and and been to this bridge please the PO set bridge and if you live close I'm not promoting bad activity but if you live near this place and you choose to go there based on this story let us know what happen I want to know I want to know this I this is this is totally going on my bucket list South Carolina I got you man I'm coming oh I'm with you I'm down we're gonna be in our cool little Auntie witch RV and we're going to tou on down to South Carolina you know I was sad because I felt like this was going to be such a short story but like I said the reason I stuck with it and decided to do it anyway is because I I I'm left with more questions than answers and and I just that's what makes it so great it does it sounds like a really fun cool place and you know my crypted to totally switch gears to go all the way up North to Montana to my crypted is another one that was kind of short but it's super fun and super interesting and and you know me my brain gets very analytical and if I can't find enough facts to a story I'll just drop it rather than keep going with right right you know I'm not just going to go on oh my friend's cousin said it was haunted there I can't do that and this was one of those stories I really got into it because it just sounded intriguing like who doesn't love a can9 crypted right and there have been a lot of them in the news lately so I thought this was a good one to talk about one of the things that was really fun about the shinka wein is that they have one stuffed what like like okay like are you talking like a stuffed animal like I'm buying my grandson or are you talking like they caught one and had a taxidis stuff the thing I'm saying they caught one in the 1800s no [ __ ] where is this thing please tell me it's on display somewhere it is still on display it was lost for a long time so this H this is in Montana this story totally legit it's totally legit this story is out of Montana I wish people could see my shocked face right now this story obviously goes way earlier than the white settlers that came the iway people the the Native American tribes in the region often uh saw this creature and they're the ones that named it the shunko wein now can you please describe it physically yes it looks like a very large wolf and they say that it has unlike like wolves usually have white gray or black fur they say that this creature is said to have very dark red or orangey brown fur sometimes black fur now does it go on the four legs or the two legs like is it like Wolf Man or still like a dog this particular one always stays on four legs but looks like a f it's got Fox colors but bigger than a wolf it does have Fox colors some people have also described it as looking a lot like a hyena because it's shoulders are much are very tall and muscular and it and it slopes downwards to smaller hips in the back like a much like a hyena oh wow and its face is different than a wolf's face it looks almost like a pig wolf more again more like a hyena face than a wolf face interesting and now again the Native American tribes in the area have talked about this creature long before the settlers came it was named the shunka wein by the Iowa and other native tribes in the area shunka wein translates into carries off dogs because it would often sneak into their camps and steal their dogs while they were sleeping at night but in the 1800s the first White settlers in Montana encountered the shunko Rakin and they said that it was a menace it was constantly attacking their animals but nothing to be scared of or just they they were just killing their animals no they were definitely afraid of it and they weren't sure what it was and it but they weren't a to catch it or really get a good look at it they just knew that it was killing off their animals and one settler a man named Israel Hutchin moved into the area again in the mid 1800s in the Madison river valley of Montana in a diary that he left he says that he encountered the shunko weaken when it first started attacking his geese and he ran out with his gun and he tried to shoot at it but he didn't manage to catch it and he was so unnerved by how it looked that he talked to other ranchers in the area about it and found that ranchers from as far as 15 miles away had seen the same creature and it had it kill some of their livestock oh wow so they knew it wasn't a wolf they knew what wolves looked like and this was not one unfortunately it kept harassing it didn't kill any people thankfully but it kept killing a lot of sheep and Birds and pigs and cattle in the area Farmers from you know 15 20 mi away reported seeing this same creature or packs of creatures that look like it even if it had traits of hyenas hyena like that's not like they're native to America right there is an American hyena that's indigenous here but this this was not it and I believe they died off it also has been described as looking like a direwolf what what what's that a direwolf is a is a very large wolf from that that was lived in North America and Eastern Asia like way back in ancient times don't ask me when because I'm not that good at history is this crypted I I I know that we try to keep East Coast West Coast United States all that but is this crypted because it being Montana has this been seen at all in Canada I believe it has been cited in Nebraska Iowa seen in um Alberta Canada so yes it has been a little bit into Canada so it's okay um Nebraska Iowa and Illinois but mostly in the Montana area so it's basically in that North Central us right centered pretty much in Montana but it does expand outward into those other areas just a little bit now these people got big bears and now you're telling me they got big dogs too like what the holy heck yeah so Israel Hutchins the gentleman who first saw this and described it to his neighbors and they all kind of came together to talk about this crazy wild creature that they had seen he deter and he was going to get it and one morning there's always one guy there's always one right he one morning his dog started barking like crazy and he went out and managed to shoot a shunkoin he took this creature which looked nothing like a wolf down to a man named Joseph Sherwood in Idaho uhuh okay this guy had a grocery store that was also a museum and okay sure well let's run with it and Sherwood fellow looks at the shunko weaken and promptly declares that it's not a wolf doesn't know what it is and he names it a ring docious a ringdocus never heard of it before I have no idea what that is do people just make up these names like are they just like all right let me just think of something that sounds totally [ __ ] up well he was a grocery store owner so he obviously knew what he was talking about and so he had it stuffed or stuffed I'm not sure if he was the taxidermist or someone else does but it was it was Taxidermy it was stuffed and then he put it on display in his grocery store Museum don't even tell me that this the local grocer was the damn taxidermist don't even he I can't even he was the museum zoologist taxidermist grocery store guy hopefully he didn't get them confused now not to be a skeptic but are there photo photogaphs of this yes there are are they now there there I'm not talking some photoshop [ __ ] are there legitimate photos of this yes there are oh wow they've done DNA sampling on it oh oh D tell did they do ancestry DNA tell me I'll get there I'll get there this animal was on display for a long time at this um Museum grocery store right in Idaho and the youngest Hutchin um event got his PhD in Zoology and he examined the creature and he didn't know what it was again keep in mind this is in the late 1800s he didn't know what it was and determined that it might possibly be some sort of hyena that could possibly have escaped from a circus okay but he wasn't sure that big though right so he says maybe it's some sort of abnormal hyena the Sherwood Museum grocery guy says that it's a ring dois but anyways it's on display until the 198 80s when it disappeared and no one could seriously was on display from the late 1800s to damn 1980 I'll show you pictures hold on so now this did not stop the attacks wait you said it got stolen it just disappeared I sounds like something I'd steal the attacks on animals in Montana did not stop there were still sightings of the shunko ween and animals were still killed and carried off by it throughout the years throughout where there's one there's more man exactly in 1995 crypto zoologist Mark Hall was called in because there was a bunch of attacks on farm animals in the area again kind of in the area in Montana and around Montana of Nebraska Iowa Illinois and Alberta Canada now was it I I have a question and it is actually relevant and I'll tell you why in a second now there's a lot of Farmland in that area was it just attacking smaller animals or was it actually going after cattle as well I believe the biggest animal that I could tell that it went after was mostly sheep because the only reason I ask is based on the size you're asking if it was going after cattle it would have to do it in packs and I was wondering if it could be a pack animal kind of like a wolf or something of the like it's described as being sometimes in packs and sometimes solitary mostly solitary but the biggest animal I was able to determine that it killed was it was sheep was the largest animal because you can kind of gauge an animal based on the size of its kill that's why I wonder if it ever went after cattle and wolves do tend to attack in packs and this one is usually alone or sometimes in a small possibly family pack because if they're in a pack they can take down bigger animals so that's why I asked yeah so the the attacks continued but they didn't really make waves a lot until 95 when this gentleman Mark Hall was called in to do some research on what could have possibly killed all these different animals and all these similar attacks in that area what you find whatd he find he stumbled upon the old stories of the shunka wein and determined that the animal did fit the pattern and that the sightings and the pictures that people took matched the old descriptions and around that same time a gentleman named Lance Foster who's an ioa Indian he told another cryptozoologist about the shunkoin he described it as a a wolf that looks a lot like a hyena and he said that it screams like a person when it's killed could it be a hybrid it could be that is one of the theories that someone it's one of the more recent theories that someone was doing wolf with a I mean I'm not saying there's lots of wolves and hyenas mating around town but some people think that it's some sort of remnant of direwolf that possibly made it with local wolves in December 2005 a shunkoin like animal began killing livestock again in the hundreds I feel like that wasn't that long ago that wasn't this this was in um in mcone Garfield and Dawson counties in Montana by October of the next year they given it poo doing about this I mean what are what are the popo doing so less than a year later it has killed over 120 animals oh my God just in that those areas alone and was called the creature of Mone County there was an article in USA Today I mean people were talking about this creature and describing it all over the place and it's definitely a shunko weak I want to talk to the county sheriff I want to have a conversation with the sheriff man right in November of 2006 the Montana Wildlife service shot and killed the creature that they suspected was responsible for you know this over 120 killing or one of the creatures that's right it looked a lot like a wolf but it didn't share any characteristics similar with wolves in the area it had orange red and yellow fur kind of like a fox right all I can think of visually when you tell me that I'm just thinking of a damn big fox because those are like the fox colors right and it's much larger it weighed well over a 100 pounds oh hey Google what's the average what's the average weight of a wolf here is some information from the that might possibly help on the adfg alaska.gov they say most adult male wolves in interior Alaska weigh from 85 to5 but they occasionally 145b and how much did you say this thing weighs 160 PBS okay so it's a little above average from a regular wolf size well an above average rare above average wolf is 145 and this is supposedly bigger than that just I not that you're like some wolf expert but can you compare me the stature like I I have a I've seen a wolf live in person my own pretty blue eyes how much stature wise taller are you talking above and beyond a wolf is it like a foot taller than a wolf like what are we talking is this like the great is this like the Great Dane of wolves like okay hold on I'm I I'm looking for a size estimate okay you know I love crypted I'm all about the detail watch this video okay this is from 2015 do you see this yeah wait till it stands up holy [ __ ] that looks like a freaking moose so that was in Montana and that wolf thing is obviously way larger than any wolf okay so guess where we're never going camping we're never going camping in Montana this thing is about three times the size of that dog and that was in 2015 so this creature is still around now they've done DNA testing the thing is is and I want to hear about the DNA but the thing I'm the thing I I'm thinking of so they kill one they see one on video This Ain't like freaking Bigfoot where there's a fin amount there's got to be packs and families where are the babies like the babies got to be a size of a German Shepherd here I think you can see a little bit there are actual pictures of the ones that they you know what that almost looks like a cross between a wolf and a boar it does look like a people have described it very similarly to that so it has some some bore like some Hy like got to be had to have been some desperate crossbreeding it's possible I don't know again some people think that it's some type of uh prehistoric animal called The Boro fages which is like a hyena like can9 that was in North America more than 13,000 years ago the borophagus was like a hyena type creature that was in the pene era which was about 13,000 years ago here in North America so some people that was just a minute ago just a minute ago so some people think that maybe that was it but now you're going to tell me what the DNA test said aren't you some of them have been inconclusive now they did find now remember the one the first one that was killed that was stuffed and disappeared in the 1980s it was found in 2007 and that one was tested as well the ones of the creatures that look like a shunko wein that have been captured some have wolf DNA okay but others are inconclusive and they're not really sure what it is is it inconclusive because they just don't know they say that from what I could tell some of them they say it had like coyote related DNA did anybody ever find any boar pig type not that I could tell but those are some of the theories that are out there that it was some sort of weird genetic experiment but that probably wouldn't explain the sightings in the 1800s and the sightings from the Ia and the other native tribes prior to that the government does some shady [ __ ] but they didn't have wherewithal in the 1800s to be doing that I believe this is a natural crazy probably hybrid couple animals that should have been should not have been breed and decided to breed kind of thing and I'm just I would be if I lived in Montana I'd be scared because this is a case of where there's one there's more I think it's kind of interesting the ones that have come back as inconclusive and I think I'm with you I feel that this is a like a Nessie Loch Ness monster kind of situation where maybe some sort of prehistoric dir wolf or bagis hyena you know kind of survived or maybe like you said survived by like interbreeding with wolves or coyotes or something and it seems like the sightings that you talked about there's been more recently than long ago and I'm wondering if this is something that is kind of much like my good friend Bigfoot migrates up and down between Northern United States and Canada or if it originally was from Canada and migrated down to the northern United States just because of climate change food resources this that and the other yeah you're talking about some Uncharted Territory it's not like we got people living all over every inch of Montana that is Wilderness and these things can just disappear right and if it's just a small population then maybe when people were first settling the area they kind of disturbed it and it moved on after that one was killed just so there were just a few you know sightings here and there until now like you said you know even there's climate change there's even more and more people moving out into the Wilderness strained resources yeah people are hiking everywhere strained water sources you know there's animals any type of animal crypted or regular you know I did not mean that to be regular um but there animals are having to shift where they look for food and water because of all kinds of things whether it be pollution or building or what have you we're we're driving the Cryptids into the city that's right so these Cryptids are coming out and this is one that uh I'm gonna say is kind of possibly true and and uh no they have a body it can't not be right and and the inconclusive tests are very intriguing to me I do really wonder if it's some sort of creature that has survived for a long time and interbred with with other wolf type populations how good a DNA test does the government really do doing on these things I say send that [ __ ] to ancestry DNA because they got it together there they do I love ancestry please ancestry DNA open up a crypted DNA testing section please oh wouldn't that be fun I kind of want to do that would you do ancestry DNA would you try to find out your your ancestry I would actually two years ago uh my children gave that to me as a Mother's Day gift I'm Jelly I want to do that so badly I'm such a m I have no idea oh no this is awesome um so both of my children and I all three of us did it and as they up the technology I will get a notification that I have more refined results because they got better technology and were able to refine my DNA so in the two two and a half years since I've had it done I've actually had like three updates and like oh how fun how neat I really want to do that no like seriously I actually just had an update like a week or so ago so I happened to have it right here oh what's it say so for me personally England in Northwestern Europe 58% Scotland 15 Wales 13 Germanic Europe 9% I thought I was way more German than I'm am apparently I'm like all freaking Great British I'm either English Scottish or Wales and I really thought i''d have more than 9% German in me oh how fun Sweden and Denmark 3% France 2% Irish 2% oh that's so cool now do you have to check a box and be like yes you can or no you can't use my DNA to solve some crime and see if I'm related to a heinous serial killer Andor rapist uh not that I recall no I just spit in a freaking thing and sent it in oh okay I don't know if you could see this this is super cool because both my kids did it but like it'll tell you my son is 38 points closer to my DNA to me than my daughter by the way you have no idea that pisses her off to her freaking core pisses her off she is your soul daughter Soul daughter but if anybody that you're family member with it will link you up together as DNA matched in an instant oh how neat but do you see how it it shows how close they are to me yes I see that that's wild super cool that is super super cool I want to find out if I have like any secret brothers or sisters out there that might dad didn't know about I honestly think that my daughter wanted the three of us to do it just to make sure their father was their father oh that sneaky little thing I want to do it I have checked into mine and I I'm related to Robert the Bruce like 10 bajillion people ago but other than that I think I'm pretty boring so it' be really cool to see yeah but you know what's even cooler about it like you click to DNA story where your ancestors came from and where they landed in America how fun how [ __ ] cool I just really want to know if I have any like secret siblings or like some like murderer I'd be afraid for you because unfortunately based on your parents background I have a feeling you could find a secret sibling I know right there's probably some weird it's it's going to come up with some cool Scandal I know it something interesting so should we do an outro for this oh yeah thank you for listening to the stone Witches Hour where we just discuss DNA Cryptids and creepy Bridges we you know we just love creepy stuff we do it's just so interesting who doesn't like it and you know besides I'm smoking good weed I'm hanging out with my bestie we're telling fun stories what's nothing better nothing beats it nothing beats it you want to do it again next week I think we should and I think there might be a person or two who might come out next week and listen oh how fun how fun who's coming out next week to listen everybody because you know what we're funny we are funny oh and we have mavin coming
