it's [Laughter] [Music] witchcraft hi and welcome to a special wheel of the Year S edition of the stoned Witches Hour on this podcast we get all witchy and talk about the eight sabbaths in the Pagan wheel of the Year sa is the third and final Harvest Festival and marks our further descent into the dark half of the year the veil between this world and the afterlife is at its thinnest point and Spirits both good and bad Walk Among Us in Disguise I'm your host Lea and tonight we celebrate the witches New Year and with me forget me I'm shell never never never forget you shell how are you on this s evening you know on the East Coast it is getting to be that S Type weather the leaves are gorgeous the air is crisp the fog is out and oh my God I just T the season I have to say I loved it while I was there all the rain the cold days the the chilly evenings the leaves walking on the sidewalk through freshly fallen leaves on a crisp autumn day on the East Coast you just can't beat it this time of year it's the best I mean I don't hate summer but this is a good time of year and and and you know what's so weird it's been very foggy here lately like very foggy Eerie like thick dense at night fog and it really kind of lends to the whole thinning of the veil concept of sa and it's just you go outside at night here and it's just like love it love it even the weather is conspiring to make everything all spooky and creepy this time of year absolutely it's it's it's perfect it's perfect I love this time of year I love this of year me too it's absolutely lovely and combin so many of my favorite things costumes and candy and skeletons apple cider apple who doesn't love apple cider and pumpkin Donuts the the one thing about AA tradition I'm gonna break right into a Sol tradition bobbing for apples have you ever bobbed for apples do you know anybody who's bobbed for apples I have bobbed for apples when I was really really little like I are you just going in like horsemouth like ah horsemouth and to this thing like I've never done this and it's like a fall tradition that I just I don't understand horse mouth and I recommend hold your breath push an apple to the side or to the bottom that's the trick don't try to catch one like in the middle of the water push it up against the bottom or the side then you can get a good grip the bottom are you going full head into this or what hey sometimes you got to go for it to get that Apple I mean you're not always going to have a good side right there for you you might have to dunk your whole face in that that thing of water I mean come on but to kind of circle back to why we're here tonight it's another tick you know how I like to call them ticks it's another tick in the wheel of the Year this this is like the witches New Year this is like the greatest a lot of people do call it the witches New Year and the reason for that is because it was considered the Celtic New Year so back in the day this was the kind of that limal space between summer and and winter you know it's the third Harvest and and everything kind of was on hold until and you're and basically it's it's like that that final ushering in of the dark half of the year because I obviously calendar-wise we look at things differently in in the modern times but I look at sa and is like the end of the outside world until spring yeah that's one of the things you have to kind of give up on the east coast is is you literally figura yeah you hermit in after s y you go within it's like you said it's ushering in that last half of the dark half of the Year this is when we really start to feel that it's the dark half of the year right right because everything I don't know if it's it's modern times have kind of conditioned us but it almost seems like nowadays and and we've talked about this in the past summer is kind of like belane to sa yeah how we gauge our outside activities belan is belane is the beginning you can go outside after that because it's warm enough too and after sa it's too damn cold that's so true and to our listeners in the southern half of the world you know hello to South Africa and New Zealand you guys are celebrating belane right now and how fabulous is that for them they're getting into the warmer half of the year so we're jealous folks well you know I kind of really like s there's a lot about s that I enjoy I mean would belting be as sweet if there wasn't a s exactly kind of that ying and yang exactly and and there's a lot to be said for I'm an introvert I kind of like the cooler days and cooler nights especially in California you don't get those that often and so it makes it easier to get outside and do things but it also makes it easier to get cozy indoors and do some crocheting or do some crafts or do things around the house work on yourself a little bit you know it it's a nice time of year to kind of balance that outward-facing belt summer but also on a spiritual level you know back in in the if if you follow the ancient Celtic spiritual Traditions they really did believe that this was kind of the the barrier between our world in the spirit world there's an easy transition now some people say that the veil is thin other people say that that door has opened however you want to convey the thought that the barrier between that physic physical world and that spiritual World breaks down to almost nothing at that point and that's where you kind of get into some of the traditions of um honoring your ancestors if you're looking to speak to folks if you want to talk to your grandma now is the time yes because this is where I personally feel that you can make those connections easier I agree this is definitely the time of year when the Kelts believed that the supernatural world world of death was very close it just kind of ran alongside this one and as the Harvest wore on as we're harvesting that grain and and things are dying we're getting closer to that Veil and and so the separation between this world and the world of the Dead gets thinner and thinner until it's almost non-existent on sin and this is like you said it's an excellent time for ancestor worship and we've spoke before of a craft you can do that was uh inspired by by Sarah and Kelly from our old Community where you take a plate because you one of the things that you can do to honor your ancestors is to have a dumb supper or to set a place at the table for them so that they can join you for your Feast I noticed um one thing they have here in in in Salem and I never heard of it before they call it a mute dinner a mute supper it's the same that's what a dumb supper means a silent supper yeah yeah and I was like wow I never heard of it referred to as that you know I know I've heard of the dumb supper but not a mute supper yeah I guess being struck dumb was an old saying like being struck speechless well and I think it also goes back to the times where they used to refer to folks with certain disabilities as deaf dumb and blind yes that's right exactly dumb really was an old-fashioned way of saying mute exactly yep and so you can take your your place setting that you're going to leave for your ancestors and Sarah had a black plate that she got a large black charger plate and around it in gold and silver she wrote the names of ancestors and people she knew that had passed on that she wanted to remember and to honor and she wrote that around the plate in a spiral and it's beautiful and that's the plate that she would use for the dumb supper and and that's a wonderful way to to connect with your ancestors building an altar is another thing that a lot of pagans and wiccans will do this time of year they put on pictures or or momentos from your ancestors little trinkets or something what one thing I do um my grandfather was a fireman and I have one of his fire badges and I put that on my altar on sa in my grandpa's fire badge my grandmother Halloween was like her freaking Mecca um she loved Halloween even more than Christmas you know you met her oh yes I remember she had this little wooden pin you know how back in like the 70s they everybody had a pin everybody wore pins yeah roaches yeah she has this little wooden pin and it's a painted cauldron oh wow nice and iar I wear that every sin even if I just your an um so I'll put my grandpa's badge on the altar but I'll wear my grandma's pen The Cauldron pen because you know that was her Jam that was her Jam that was her holiday and even if it wasn't to remember ancestors I would have done that anyway because that was her favorite holiday I love that I absolutely love that when I was a kid on my grandmother's mantle I always remember seeing this little buddha guy oh that's so cute this little statue now my grandparents were Christian although my grandmother did introduce me to tarot cards when I was little she very much liked spirituality she was into divination and Tarot she's the one with the Ouija board so this little guy is is something I remember on her mantle and after she and my grandfather passed away we were all told we could take something of theirs and this is what I asked to have so this little buddha this little Buddha statue is my little good luck guy a that's cute yeah I've had him since I was 19 and he goes on my altar um as my remembrance of my grandparents as one of my ancestor items that goes on my altar aside from from the ancestor altars and and and offerings uh to our past on loved ones and such bread I don't know why bread but because it's like the final Harvest I don't know I always want I want bread product sa yes because we're cutting down the grains it's that it's that ancient tradition of the Harvest and cutting and threshing of the grains and so baking of bread is an actual symbolic act because sa is life and death it's it's everything it's all of that and and when you're harvesting the bread or when you're harvesting the grain you're killing it you're you're cutting it down that's the whole death of the green man you know and you cut down that grain and everything goes quiet and fallow for the winter but then you bake bread out of it and now you've created something new you have new life and you have bread so it's a wonderful way to remember that I know that in Mexico for the Day of the Dead celebration which is right around the same time on the 1 one of the things they do is bake cookies and sweet things to remind you of the sweetness of life I just wanted to say one thing that the Kelts also did was they would leave out Bak Goods or cookies or things of that nature out for the fairies so they would leave out stuff for the fairies and the shei because that was kind of like their last offerings of the Year exactly and they were kind of trying to buy them off for the winter months you know exactly the way the the veil is thinnest and it's not just your ancestors that are coming back it's bad people it's tricksters it's the she it's the F it's F it's the tuad it's it's you know you might be caught up in the wild Hunt on this night and so people would dress up and wear masks to kind of to fool the bad spirits that would come around they they'd carve turnips and other gourds later pumpkins and light them to scare away bad spirits and they'd leave offerings for the good ones and to appease the bad ones to maybe kind of leave them alone and that kind of is what led to the modern day Jackal lanterns um and and costumes and whereas sa and the Day of the Dead Dia deos muos are very very similar in that its ancestor wor ship and honoring those that have gone before and using lights and offerings and and in deos muos it's called an NOA the altar that you put up for your ancestors we just call it an altar but we use a lot of the same things well it's it's more about it's more about celebrating the dead it's not about grieving the dead and I think probably a very important distinction to make to folks sa is the thought behind it is definitely not grieving based it's more celebratory based and it's not to say you might not be sad inviting you know your deceased loved one over for dinner but essentially you're inviting them back into your home to be part of your family again while warding off the bad ones or the she right you know that trickster ly out there people Loki will come to you on sa you don't want that kind of Mojo exactly and and while Halloween is kind of derived from sin it it's not the same you know there's the whole giving of offerings and the possible tricksters and the wearing of masks uh and the carving of pumpkins but a lot of those Traditions came to the United States in the in the 1840s when the the Irish came here after the famine and they brought with them a lot of a lot of their sa Traditions including asking for food masks asking for food from Neighbors for the feast you know and trickster things you know causing trouble and it got to be so out of hand that I believe in the early 1900s some major cities started having San celebrations on all Halls Eve or Halloween to kind of tone down some of the Mischief Night and S trickster things that were happening but back when when some of those Celtic Traditions um were brought over here by the Irish and and whatnot you know we've talked about this on other Sabbath episodes about the correlating Christian holidays people forget because in in for Pagan folk this is absolutely a high holiday it's like our Christmas one of the four major sabbaths of the year right and people forget that there is a Christian correlated holiday um they've made it a lesser holiday but November 1st is All Saints Day and that was kind of their way of trying to you know we've talked in the past about how they tried to sway the pagans Away by creating their holidays around the same times so kind of to combat sin they have All Saints Day yep and again they couldn't stop people from celebrating the old ways and so they kind of Incorporated it into their ways I mean you'll legit see them do the the dumb supper and have the bread and all the same things so that's kind of the Christian holiday that's now around this time we've also mentioned the um deos muos the Mexican holiday The Day of the Dead and I I feel a lot of kinship with that because it is so similar to sa and do love bones my idea of Bones being we all have a skeleton you know bones are the same underneath us all and they last for a very long time they fascinate me we're still finding bones of people that are thousands of years old I mean come on that's so cool but I'm I'm one of those parents you know my kids are in their 20s and I still have every one of their teeth when they every baby tooth from both those kids I have still to this day I did until I ritually let them all go so the thing is is that I somewhere in my head I'm like I don't want somebody getting their hands on my kid's bones God knows what they're gonna do with them right sure sure bones are important they contain our DNA they contain so much and so la Katarina and the they have a lot of the sugar skulls and things like that in deados MOS right around now is also dwali I believe dwali just ended that's a festival of lights it's not exactly about death but it is about life and rebirth and growth and that kind of thing and that happens often this time of year I believe dwali started on uh Sunday October 23rd if I'm not mistaken yeah and I think it goes for five days right right so and yeah and that's you know and that's again not the same but it is a holiday that's going on now and it does have to do with it's the Festival of Lights it's the the Triumph of good over evil you know I do think the the important thing to to kind of always remember no matter what you believe is no matter your religion your belief your spirituality we all have coinciding holidays it's interesting to me that this time of year is it's that Harvest time of year you know when people really we start to figuratively go inward sa is a good time to sacrifice what didn't work for you reflect reflect is a good word I like to use with sa it's a good time to reflect on the last year as well as how do I want the next year to go yeah a a great ritual I like to do on sin is to l Al do a ritual of Letting Go you know not just ancestor work but you can also take something about yourself or a relationship that you didn't like or or something that happened during the year that that wasn't you know good for you you can write that down on a piece of paper and if you're lucky enough to be in a community that has a bonfire you can throw that into the bonfire and release that for the you know during this time is a great time to let go of that what that doesn't serve you you know sacrifice it you know how I'm weird and I'm different than everybody else you know what I've done for a long time on sin and it is so against what everybody else does what's that I actually make wishes oh and you want to know why why because I feel like uh I mean you know that I I've always had kind of that that connection especially with my grandfather yes I remember remember my garage apartment when my grandfather would show up and that ghost his ghost was there all the time [ __ ] would move blankets that you were near would suddenly get an indentation in it like someone sat down it was freaky but you know I kind of always looked at it as a time where I kind of focused more specifically um on my grandparents and um you always so close with him I always kind of took it as a time where I could specifically ask him for wishes oh because he's right there not like a wish upon a star kind of a wish but hey Grandpa could you help me out here like those kind of like a specific you know what I'm saying I've taken that approach because I feel like that's like the best timee you know what I mean I love that I would talk to a lot of times I would talk to my grandmother my mother's mother that that passed away before I was born but I've often been told I am her twin I'm her spitting image and I act like her I talk like her very much a lot like her and I I feel very connected to her in a lot of ways she was very cool lady from everything I understand and so I can I can feel her very strongly on sin and I do enjoy being able to talk to her a little more closely and and that's something um taking some time to meditate to set up your altar with pictures with notes to people that you love have a little fire or a candle if you can't have a fire and write a letter or write a physical note to someone that has passed on and and burn it let it go it's a great way to communicate with Spirits it's also Al an excellent time to um to do divination or to to get a tarot reading to get an astrology reading from someone it's also a good time to take that one last walk out in nature before you have to wait six months to do it again oh my gosh yes if you are in on the East Coast or you're in a climate where you're going to get trapped inside because the weather is going to be [ __ ] then definitely take that time you know it's really nice in California Southern California the weather is just balmy and perfect this time of year you know it does start to get a little bit colder I can't do exactly all the things you want to outside so yeah enjoy the weather get out while you can and try to soak it all in you know one last cool tradition U I don't know if you remember this but one sa uh ritual we did with when we were in the Pagan Community back in Upstate New York together do you remember the time we sat around in part of the ritual was telling ghost stories I thought that was cool as [ __ ] what a better time to tell ghost stories it's an amazing time to tell ghost stories I mean how fun is that I don't know I feel like I do more reading this time of year I do more investigating this time of year maybe it's just because I don't leave the house this time of year it kind of gets back to this is the time of year to reflect this is the time of year to go inward you know ask your relatives about stories from their past you know ask about stories of people that aren't there anymore you know if you if you know someone who has gone on and you know have know someone who was close to them ask for a story about them ask for a memory of their life another thing I did because you know we are in the modern world now and you and I are both parents to some lovely lovely children we we still have to buy into the hype of Pop Culture Halloween I kind of love Pop Culture Halloween I do love I love Halloween I love S I love Halloween love it all I actually we you know I'd take the kids out trick-or treat and I would make them leave a piece of candy I don't know if you remember in my old house I had that front porch that I never used a lot M each kid would leave a piece of candy out on that front porch Oh leaving offerings for the Fay is definitely an excellent idea now they'd of course leave a piece of candy that they didn't want but that wasn't the point yeah leaving an offering for the Fay if you are having a dumb supper and you serve food onto that plate you can a lot of times take that plate outside and leave it uh for the Fay and for the creatures out outside if you're able to but I love your idea of leaving a piece of candy out but be forewarned our our our listeners don't know this but you do I used to have my beautiful kitty cat Salem remember Salem I do remember Salem so one year one of my children decided to leave out a Jolly Rancher because it was a flavor they didn't like well apparently I used to let this cat this was an indoor out outdoor cat and we had let him out and he must have ripped the package there's whatever and when he had come in when he had come into the house a day or two later guess what was stuck in his damn fur that I had to cut out the Jolly Rancher offering he had the thickest the blackest the most floofy fur with a watermelon Jolly Rancher stuck in them that must have been terrible well then I thought it was bad mojo because I'm like oh my God the cat takes the offering you know if a neighbor kid took it whatever but I'm like the cat stay away man you know you knew this cat he knew better he did he should have known better he was just messing with us it was just one of those simple I mean every kid's willing to give up one piece of candy I I will also admit this is the time of year I love to throw on my black cloak and go haunting the local graveyards just to see what I can see pick up an acorn or a cute Branch that's now a wand or something like that and uh I love it look for stones or Hollow what are they the wish Stones the ones with the holes in them stones tag stones and of course creepy me when I was a teenager I found the bones of a bird and I was so thrilled and I had those on my altar forever oh my God that you would do that I'd be like I wouldn't even touch that [ __ ] and you'd be like yeah let me take that home I did too there's where our witchy differences lie you are all bones and stuff and I'm like man has that [ __ ] been sanitized but people think you need to spend a lot of money you know I I had someone I was talking to earlier this week in my day job and we were talking about like alter stuff um I happened to work with someone who's like oo there's another witch at work let's talk and you know I don't mind no when have you ever minded and you know she's like well I was at this store in this store and that some of that stuff's expensive I'm like you know what go outside get yourself a Red Leaf that just blew off a tree go get a twig that broke off of this take five of those twigs and make a pentacle out of them and take some Sho string and tie them together boom there you go people think that it's all about what you spend on your altar nope it's not something that you made is always going to be better than something that you bought I not to say that things that you buy aren't awesome I love pretty things oh I love pretty things give me shiny things all day long but pretty things are pretty not necessary right and not necessarily powerful sin is also a time when I like to actually do ritual it it's the veil's too thin for me to just want to sit there and kind of visualize almost like an obligation yeah you know and and to wear your black your protective color and to go outside make a circle of leaves make a you know kind of break out a circle in your fall leaves if you're lucky enough and have that barrier or use bird seed and walk a circle you know call each quarter use your air your fire your water and your Earth and walk the circle to protect it and to bind your circle and make a safe space to do your ritual to do your Memorial to your ancestors or to to honor that third Harvest or to to sacrifice something from your past and to move forward you know it's doing ritual on that night is Just it feels different it hits different I think one thing that I've also found very important about this time specifically not only has the Earth sacrificed in the form of you've taken down your crops you've chopped them down you've cut them down you've dug them out of ground whatever hell you're doing with your crops just as the Earth has to make that sacrifice what's your sacrifice you're going to go into the new year you gotta give something up that's the deal that's right whether it's a habit whether it's I don't know what you got to give something up almost like a New Year's resolution exactly exactly it's an excellent time to do that and I have to say that there was a sound in particular right before I met my husband that I was finally ready to let go go of bad habits of the past old relationships of the past things that hadn't worked for me you know I was ready to just let go of all of it start new and just really be happy with myself right not look for relationships or anything oh I remember that s and I also remember the following belain so that s after the community ritual while the bonfire was still up I did a small ritual I had a friend do a heart beat drum and everything and I threw some things into the bonfire to kind of sacrifice that past and let go and start new and that belain my bestie was convinced to bring the love of my life to belan you're welcome thank you thank you thank you thank you so but I think it really started that s when I was ready to make those sacrifices when I was ready to let go of things that didn't serve me finally ready to grow up and to shed those things and and I'm not going to say that it was easy because it wasn't it was hard and it was difficult it was a very heart-wrenching ceremony but and look what you got out of it six months later exactly exactly just because something's hard to let go of doesn't mean that you shouldn't you know and there was I had a lot of baggage from a lot of [ __ ] in my past and I was more than more than willing to kind of throw that in the fire and let the new year start fresh and half a wheel of the year later I reaped the rewards so it's worth it and look folks here we are 20 some years later and they're still happily in love that's so true but it but it it that change in in you all started with giving something up that's exactly right what's the sacrifice yep that's right I don't believe in resolutions resolutions are kind of weird but sacrifices I guess you could say it the same I guess you could say it's different but I guess it sounds better if you call it a sacrifice and not a resolution well if you don't sacrif if you make a resolution you're just kind of making a problem to yourself you're lying to yourself oh we know how you feel but if you sacrifice something and let go of things that aren't serving you that's a little bit different you're not really making a promise so much as cleaning house as letting things in your life go that need to be let go and sometimes you need to do that just like the Earth that lets things die you need to just let things die exactly just like what was her name Pan's mother um the goddess of Hearth and heart home uh not HEC demer demer there you go so Pan's mother demer you know sacrificed her daughter her daughter went to the underworld and she had to let her go and and so now everything is kind of dying and because she's sad about her daughter being gone you know so you've got pranie and Hades as Gods this time of year which we've actually um we used to do some Passion Play based rituals and we actually kind of did that whole pany demer Hades transitioning to the underworld dark half of the Year concept for a ritual and I loved it I miss it let's do it again we should I miss Community I do have to say I very much Miss that community and I I haven't really found anything to replace that let's see another a goddess that you're familiar with HEC she's a a good triple goddess for this time of year to call upon definitely the going Within and seeing what you hide from yourself and those are the things that you can kind of really delve into at this time of year oh absolutely absolutely there's so much about looking at the dark half of yourself you know being comfortable with who you are when you're alone and and kind of going through all of that the Ying is easy the Yang not so much here we are yeah not so much that's right the fire obviously was a is a symbol of life and back in the day the ancient Kelts from what I understand people would put out the fires throughout the whole village everybody's fire would go out all the Hearth fires and they would light one fire bonfire or bone fire because it would often be lit with bones um but they would light this main bonfire and then everyone would come to that as part of the celebration and they would take fire from that Central bonfire back to their home and relight their hearth fire with it and it's just kind of a a reminder that this that fire is life and that everyone is connected and we would stay up late at rituals little late one thing I always remember is uh as that fire was dying at the end of the night and you know Upstate New York end of October little chill a little bit as that fire went down it would sink in because we'd start to freeze yeah from the rituals before where it was warm and comfortable all night long and we could Dr Dance It's s you walk away from that fire your ass is cold so it kind of gives you that everything is shutting down everything is is kind of retreating just like the fire is dying down the light is dying down is that fire goes dark we go dark as well that's right that's right and and so we kind of have to hold on to that fire and the memory of that fire and we have to use this time of going within and darkness to find new talents to to find new things to start sa is also a good time for storage by storage I specifically mean this is where a lot of cultures and societies would get the final Harvest and and their final crops in a state of storage back at MB and we talked about canning um and and doing those types of things the stuff that they've been able to harvested since mabin through sin again they're either going to be packed away to sustain through winter canned to sustain through winter whatever the case may be based on the crop so this is also kind of the final Gathering time of food and and supplies hunkering down for winter if you're lucky enough to be able to dry your own herbs or you know store your own crop you know Brava more power to you you know if you can't maybe you want to you know buy some fresh herbs at the store and dry them or maybe you just want to try your hand a new craft you know maybe you don't actually necessarily want to make bread or want us to can something but now's now's a good time to learn something new to kind of like you said read more books expand yourself expand your expand your knowledge expand your thought process I mean the light really starts to come back as we'll talk about again in imul come out of the light better however whatever's better for you come out better so basically we've ascertained that um from Sou in until roughly belane it pretty much sucks on the East Coast so you guys all need to learn how to knit and on the west coast we're going to be surfing and hiking and biking and having a grand old time you know you and I talked about this previously but I actually I I have a plan for my dark half of the Year oh what is your plan for the dark half as most of our listeners have gathered over time um especially if you follow us on Instagram I am what they call a Tarot deck cor I have an addiction problem with tarod deex love them love them love them but I am going to spend my dark parts of this year learning a new divination technique oh do tell what are you going to learn I love tea I've always loved tea I don't like coffee true people do not judge me do not send us hate mail about me hating coffee it's a thing and so I've always dranked tea my whole life I love tea you know it never dawned on me to do tea readings until recently so yeah I don't know I guess I was so obsessed with t that's true you you've been literally obsessed with tarot for as long as I've known you right so you know 160 decks later I uh I I I think that number has gotten bigger from the last time you said it on here shell have an intervention yeah we kind of to do I'm gonna delve into uh learning how to do some te Leaf readings that sounds fantastic you know I have to say I I've gotten a new Tarot deck recently but like I've gotten one and in that same time I think you've gotten 12 I am on a first name basis with my Amazon guy as well as tarot shops in town I'll admit it it's a problem folks but if you ever want to look at a deck let me know because I probably have it and can send you pictures and hey if you want a sa and tarot reading shell and I are would both be uh happy to to give you a little one well maybe not all of you but maybe one or two of you if you're good that's right but shoot us an email and uh maybe we got something in the cards for you oh I like the sounds of that this is an excellent time of year for divination whatever your flavor of divination is and I have to say I too am going to be doing something interesting that involves divination what what what well do you remember how we kind of made Ouija boards when we were together in Salem that was the best Ouija board I've ever used in my life by the way folks there's a picture of it on Instagram that [ __ ] is topnotch I have decided that I am going to use one of two methods to permanently preserve our beautiful cardboard Ouija boards I'm either going to cast it in resin epoxy resin or I'm going to decoupage it onto a nice piece of wood so if anyone has an opinion should I use epoxy resin and encase it in that and make it all cool or should I decoupage it onto like a really nice piece of wood well maybe one of our listeners has tried both of those things and would be able to actually tell us if one of them is a good or a bad idea there you

kind that's right be kind to each other be kind humans we need a little more kindness in this world and you know maybe one of the bad habits you could shed at sin is being more loving to humans you don't want to shed that you want to add that yeah well I was gonna I was trying I was initially gonna say you need to shed being an [ __ ] here and there but I thought that was kind of mean so I was trying to turn it around and it didn't work out for me shed your not so niceness folks be kind yes I'm with shell on this one do some divination if you have kids take them out trick-or Trea in because I still say I don't care what anybody says trick-or-treating with your kids is a is is a equally beautiful way to celebrate s and if you show up at my door and you say trick-or treat you're getting candy I don't care how tall you are I don't care how old you are if you're polite and you say trick-or treat I got candy for you [ __ ] how am I going to get to California for for candy knocking on your door I love it we decorate to the nines and everyone loves our house we always have so much fun I do love being in a neighborhood where lots of kids come through it is a blast and you know actually that's one one last thing I wanted to quickly mention because you you sparked this idea I had someone at work ask me if Halloween offended me as a witch do you feel do you know any witches or pagans or wicens that are actually offended by like Halloween proper no I don't um that's not to say there aren't any but I can't think of any the only thing I can think of where I've ever heard of anyone being offended was there were some signs uh at a Walmart one years ago that was basically like burn the witch I don't know there was there was some the only good witch is a Dead witch there was some signs like that that I know people really really worried people and found offensive but other than that I've never heard of that it my in my former workplace uh when I when I was still in New York state I would get offended on how my workplace their idea of decorating for Halloween was pretty much solely green-faced witches and like they knew that I was Pagan and knew that I was a witch and I felt like it was a dig and I really because of that kind of came to hate the green-faced witch thing I love wizard of Ozz don't get me wrong but I love green don't get me wrong love Bora I love Bora but but somehow that green face witch can tend to rub me the wrong way but as long as people aren't ridiculously offensive I am down with Halloween I love dressing up I love going out I was brokenhearted when my kids stopped trick-or-treating it like 18 or 20 years old yeah but I will I would be the first person you give candy to teenagers folks because those teenagers could be vandalizing procreating when they're too young to doing drugs give them the candy if they knock on your door there's nothing wrong with it and as a parent of children who were taller than me by the time they were 9 years old no joke true story true story don't tell me my kids are too old she was nine nine just because they're tall doesn't mean they're not little my kids I can't remember if it was 18 or 20 but my kids trick or- treated until they were like 18 or 20 I would have happily given them candy yeah no joke I have zero problems with that I love it but I I was in a neighborhood where people embraced the concept if they're trick-or-treating they're not causing trouble just the kids candy I do remember one year trick-or-treating in your neighborhood with my kids and we had a blast because the neighborhood went all out there were adults giving adult beverages to other adults that were trick-or-treating people were you know pulling wagons behind them with food there were barbecues there was music it we were walking down the street in cloaks and nobody was looking at us with weird faces oh yeah I always dress up as a witch yeah what's your costume really this is me 365 yeah so folks we want you to have a happy and safe sin we want you to have a happy and safe day of the dead in New Year and we'll catch you for the next tick in December and we'll see you on the other side of the veil thanks for listening to the stoned Witches Hour with shell and Lea if you like what you heard please rate US and consider giving us a review it really helps the show out and we'll
