religions we would love to welcome Phyllis kirat to the show hi phis hi oh what a pleasure to be here thank thank you very much for doing this show especially before the parliament oh my gosh I'm am so very excited about the parliament of world religions this year and I was thrilled several months ago to stumble upon a video of you with your call to conscience when you uh that very rousing speech uh inspired me to volunteer actually we're very very excited about it as much as we are blessed Phyllis this I have to I have to talk about this Parliament here because I found out a great fun fact not only about the event itself but about your particular role in this a few years back in 1993 is is fate would have it I have found out that you were the first officer of the Covenant of the goddess and you went to Parliament and you kind of created a couple of controversies do you want to just talk real quick about that because I find I find great correlation between where you were in 1993 at Parliament and where you are to day and your role in the parliament that's coming up in the next week or so oh interesting yeah so you never know right um so yeah 1993 uh I was the first officer the come into the goddess and uh off we went to the parliament with uh a bunch of folks from uh Cog um and members of other uh communities uh Earth Spirit Circle Sanctuary of course um um Selena Fox Andress arthon both of whom were very involved and uh Andre sadly no longer but Selena continues to be and there were about 50 of us quite a number of folks from the Chicago Pagan Community when we got there it turns out that there had been a problem uh we had not made a proper application to the city to get a permit in order to do a basically a full moon ritual in gr Park in the public as part of our participation at the parliament it was remarkable that we were there that there uh there was somebody on the board who knew what witches actually were who wiccans really are and what pagans really believe and practice and so they made sure that we were able to get in and that a number of our programs were accepted for presentation which was just a blessing right because truly if you think that there's still you know distorted stereotypes today 30 years ago 30 years worse I mean 600 years worse right I heard you were boycotted by the Greek and Russian Orthodox as well yes so what happen so we arrived and the um the Greek Orthodox Church left and they were quite explicit that they uh were not going to be there if there were witches present oh wow and if they were pagans present and I gathered there was an effort um by the parliament board to try to keep them and they refused to stay and they left and so that was controversy number one that got a ton of publicity and the second one was our ritual because we our permit wasn't in place I went to get the permit fixed and the city refused and I said you can't refuse you've granted ok to all these other religions to hold things in the you can't refuse us just because you don't know who and what we're about and you have all these negative stereotypes in your eyes and I like yeah no well actually we can and we're GNA give you a permit and I spent about half the rest of the parliament fighting them and brought in the ACLU which I was a member of and had been on the board of and you know I know they are staunch allies especially when it comes to um freedom of religion and freedom of speech they climbed on board and together we were able to get the permit and to go ahead with the ritual so that got a ton of publicity it was really our emergence onto the global stage because getting all this press largely because of controversy but which taught me a lot of lessons if you want press you know controvers but I feel like you spent that whole Parliament fighting for inclusion and now you're coming full circle 30 years later you are the chair of Parliament and let please let us know what the topic of this year's Parliament is okay well I'm not the chair of the of the Board of Trustees I'm the program chair program chair program chair but but um yeah but a huge basically huge responsibility it's it's been 30 years of working with the Parliament and serving as a trustee um in 2015 I created the inaugural women's assembly and the women's plenary women's task force and had to fight like heck to open that space But it was the only way that I could see that we were going to get the goddess on stage right and we're going and witches and pagans on stage because it wasn't happening in the other plenaries and it worked and it also changed the Parliament and it opened up um the community of the par to the voices of women women make up 65% of the attendees at the parliament I when I after that I was done I was like I'm done I'm done they asked me to come back I came back and I said okay they asked me to serve as program chair and I said okay but if we're going to do this we did it for the online I served as program Chef for the online convening two years ago if we're going to do this we have to have the courage of our convictions and that means that we have to stand up as an Interfaith Community individually as practitioners of faiths whatever those faiths may be and collectively in mutual support we have to stand up together and we have to say no to this spread of global Fascism and I thought the board would say no but they agreed and so you know put the Bell on the cat so that's what uh we've been doing and it's going to be a very very strong program yes where it's going to be a lot of straight on straight talk about white Christian nationalism about racism um about the spread of fascism and autocracy at home here where we are in Poland in Hungary in Turkey in India now in Israel obviously in Russia it is a global issue it is a global issue and what is missing from the conversation is the moral leadership ship of religious leaders and at the heart of how one of the one of the key strategies they use lies they use propaganda I mean there are all these different strategies that fascists use in order to gain power and one of them tried and true hideous grotesque and utterly reliable is othering is to find the scapegoat and that was us right it was women it was witches it was pagans right it was other indigenous Traditions find the other and demonize them and and use fear and confusion and tribalism and and anger and direct it at the scapegoat so that they do not know who is actually their enemy and and so it's close to home right because we are we continue to be a persecuted faith and with the rise of white Christian nationalists which is just a long way of saying neo-nazis or Nazis that's a long way of saying Nazis uh in this country who are being legitimized by um Donald Trump we're back in their SES again and we never left the sites fully of the evangelicals but it's they're becoming very aggressive again and demonizing us and so it's essential we need the Allies that we've cultivated over the years in in the Interfaith community and everyone of every faith our fats are intertwined and we need each other very much so so this is a chance to speak up do you feel we've taken a step back as far as inclusion where at the parliament or culturally or just culturally sure you know one of the things that I mean it's a more complex conversation it is yes is yes that that there are people right who who have tra traditionally been privileged but it's a dubious privilege for for working class white males my father who was Union organizer and very Progressive um was a workingclass guy and made a a small income worked incredibly hard was physically and emotionally damaged by it because his shift changed it excuse me every two week two weeks his skin gave him a tremendous privilege over a a black person doing the same work but he was hardly privileged he was you know um perception of privilege it's all relative and those who are toally privileged manipulate the feelings of um disenfranchisement that a white majority has had in this country for a long time and they manipulate it and they exploit it and they shift attention away from those who are actually exploiting them to blacks and Browns and immigrants and others right it's the other INR their fault and you're you're getting less because of them not because of us us because we broke your unions and made it too expensive for you to send your kids to school and and pump opioids into your communities after we sent the factories you know overseas oh it's not us it's you know are explo so you know it's an old strategy and it always works and um and when you try to argue for solidarity you come up against uh racism and misogyny and fear it's hard it's it's it's really it's it's very you know it's not easy if it was easy things would be different that's true and I think that's why we need things like the parliament as I was going through the the different workshops and plenaries and people who are speaking I'm very much loving the diversity there's so many different people cultures religions represented all looking for an answers to social justice problems answers to climate change answers to the authoritarianism and one of the things that I was very happy to see is a very strong Pagan presence throughout the entire thing because we are so tied to the Earth we are so tied to these different social justice movements and I've been hearing people thanking you and the Parliament for including these because I think it has been a need it has been a want for people to see this because a pagan ISM for varied reasons has become very very popular lately people are hungry for this type of connection with the Earth with each other and and I think hosting things like the the Parliament and having that inclusion there is a wonderful way for people to see that representation and really hopefully start to take those lessons home with them and to um you know maybe make some changes on a smaller scale once they get back home so um I'm very much looking forward to that it's a it's one of it's I mean it's one of the most important Platforms in the world right in terms of religious dialogue and Interfaith dialogue and it was incredibly important for us to be there um because we were so misunderstood and we still are but it's an opportunity for people to discover who and what we're really all about for us to share that um from a sort of spiritual movement point of view it also requires us to up our game is when you communities these people who have seminaries these are people who have you know rigorous training programs these are people who can talk about their theologies you know this you got to up your game and I think it's helped I think it's helped us mature uh to to become even more committed to our own faiths and to practice them with more devotion and coherence and to become ambassadors to the outer world I mean I've been doing this I've been a witch he was for 44 years since I was initiated something like that 43 years 44 years you're one of the first to speak up yeah me it was me and Margot yeah Selena yeah that was it there was three of us that were public and I mean s was Pagan but she was public but she was public within you know the community as opposed to in the mainstream right um so watching us mature in this larger company I mean it's it's good for us and we bring these values of the divine feminine of the importance of women as spiritual leaders of the imminence of the Divine of the innate Divinity of the natural world and the relationship that we have to have to remedy that we have to heal right um I do think that we need a stronger presence in the climate action task force and in the climate action plenaries or assemblies and programming there's some but there's not enough but there's good we have about 30 Pagan programs which include you know the our our Central spiritual principles about reverence to the Earth and and we have a whole bunch of rituals um and rights and ceremon ceremonies around the sacredness of Mother Earth and honoring the how to honor the four directions and there's going to be a new moon ritual down by the banks of the Lake Michigan right inide of the indigenous fires that are I'm bringing my drum am it's going to be a maiden and a mother and a croning ritual in the women's Sacred Space which is always very Pagan and there are altars it's going to be an altar to Mother Earth and there's going to be an altar to the divine feminine and to the goddess and and we're going to have a strong presence throughout gustara um who's a Garian uh high priest third degree he's been around for a long time brilliant scholar wonderful soul I invited him to be um the other Pagan uh plenary speaker so he'll be speaking in community and I read his talk and it's great um and uh Lara Gonzalez uh is going to give um who is both uh Mexican American and uh Wiccan is going to give a prayer in the opening plenary so I'm very excited about I am so excited I'm so thrilled about all of these programs and you've been on everything lately you're very busy I've heard you've been on podcasts and YouTube channels and interviews and I was listening to one of them recently it was the um magnify your Miracles podcast with Reverend Francis fayen and you said something that keeps ringing in my head you said the world needs her witches and I cannot stop thinking about that phrase and and seeing all these social justice Pagan programming climate change Pagan programming at the parliament of world religions and and it just really helps to magnify that idea and that thought and I it just resonates so strongly with me thank you that's my praise the world needs her witches it's true it's just true and she does she needs us right she does and I think more of us need to get involved and and be active and I I'm very grateful that I have the privilege to be able to everything kind of fell into place to be able to go and volunteer which is wonderful as magical Things Are want to do you know things just kind of happen when it's supposed to happen that way but not everybody is privileged enough to be able to go to something like this to to get involved like that and hopefully we can find some ways you know through these podcasts through your book your classes to to get involved a little bit more locally now I I know you have a class coming up you're going to be teaching a master class oh wow they sent you that yes yep I am doing a master class which is composed of the two programs that were there three programs essentially we we left behind the constraints of the coven structure about 20 years ago because you cannot build a movement with 13 people studying for three years you just it's you're never going to grow at a rate that's going to have an impact on the world that is going to bring the wisdom and the teachings and the practices right and the value that we hold into the world to have an impact it it you know I was just you know I'm talking to her and him and they were very clear right covens are good not saying that you know you should have them everybody should have them but that's not the way you're going to do what needs to get large scale change exactly and so um and also I was traveling to Europe a lot because all my books were coming out all over Europe I mean all over Slovakia bellarus I it's R May where the Spellbook is out in China now well we can we can relate on a small scale because our podcast is number one in Gambia yeah hi gamb hi Gambia shout out to you so so I was like okay so how are we gonna do this we're gonna create a class that anybody can take and I the other thing I've been saying for a very long time if you work it it'll work and you don't have to be a witch for our practices to work for you you're going to be Hindu to practice yoga or Buddhist to meditate you don't have to be a witch to understand and to experience the grace casting a circle of honoring the directions of absolutely many of our practices that reconnect you to the magic of creation to the Divine energies of that are that are right that are embodied by creation and so I started teaching so so I have three classes basically one is I call the wand and it's the active principles right and it's the do you know this is how you honor the four directions this is how you C Circle this is how you set up an altar this is what it means to be an altar this is how you invoke beginning too this is how you honor the Divine this is how you make magic with the elements so it's very structural fundamental practices tools and techniques like a one1 class kind of like a one1 but you know the way I teach nothing's ever 101 a very shamanic orientation which has been integrated into practice since 1982 I have a particular orientation on How I Do It um so it's Wick 101 but it's you know it's right it's it's yeah and then it's followed by so it's six weeks of that followed by six weeks of the gril work and the gril work is are the receptive practices so it's Al States Of Consciousness divination shamanic journeying and working with um spirits of place which was an instruction that I received from them about how to recast this and then the creation of ritual uh that is a that is a creation that comes out of your relationship with the spirits of place so it's rather than it being ritual as a creation of your intention it's the creation of ritual as an expression of communion as a very I like that incredibly powerful and so that so you're pulling together all the things you've learned in the first SE in the wand segment the things the skills you've developed in the in the Grail and then we culminate with this uh very powerful and I like that's always done in person but we're doing this online uh because you can you know you adapt and you change and if you want to change the world then you change how you're communicating so we're doing it online and yeah I'll start it most likely in October um I'm excited so it's 12 weeks I'm not sure yet whether it'll be continuous or whether it'll be six weeks with a break and then six weeks it's uh it's not an overwhelming amount of work it's a two week class every week and then work and work in a circle with other people so that you're getting feedback so you you know you have to be willing to commit some at least I would say four hours a week um over the course of six weeks probably break six weeks um first round will be um more accessible because I'm going to be working a few things out because it's online and if you want to be initiated um it's requirement but you don't you know that doesn't have to be the reason you take it the reason that you take it is because you want to learn you're curious and you've never done this you you've been doing it and you want to deepen your practice you've been doing it in a different style or tradition and you've heard you know that I have a particular shamanic orientation towards the work and and what I say makes sense to you and you want to expand your skills in that way it's uh I'm excited I'm really excited to do it it sounds like like a wonderful course all three of them sound like really Great Courses and your your YouTube channel you have some wonderful videos there and also on I love your Instagram follow your Instagram you have great little Snippets of things there you know definitely a fun way but you know I'm very much enjoying your book um the most recent we have all of them you know we remember you from back um back in the day yeah and um so spells for living well is your current book and it's one that I have been using with my with my 17 and 20-year-old daughters who are also very much and it has been fabulous for that so we are very much enjoying it to work together and kind of for me to get back into my practice and for my my children to kind of learn and grow in the practice so thank you very much for that book it's wonderful I didn't intend to do a spell book but the publisher came to me and I said I have a very different perspective on spells you know I'm not twitching my nose and pulling levers grinding bat's eyeballs I mean you understand that right they're like no that's why we want you to do it um because for me um I mean I started out in that very traditional kind of patriarchal magical way of like that you know that a spell as a way of of uh you know using your intention and your willpower to manipulate unseen forces and get what you want and after you know and very often that worked but very often not in the way as you expected and a lot of times it didn't and there were lessons to be learned even it did work and gradually really was writing Book of Shadows the very first book that made me really really reflect on what magic truly is because when I wanted to write about my experiences as a young lawyer who in the million years could never imagin becoming a witch that I wanted to bring people into that experience right so they could feel that they were present and feel that they were encountering the Divine goddess and and feel that their their power were expanding I realized that magic wasn't about manipulating right that magic was about opening yourself to the flow of this extraordinary life generating you know Spirit manifesting magic power Grace that that will work with you you know if you ask it to and it's a different posture it's yeah sometimes you have to throw you know you got to like stamp your feet yell real you know the old cartoon like hitting the donkey in the head with the stick and the guy goes why are you doing that he says I gotta get his attention you know like that sometimes it feels like spellcasting the Italian style you gotta smack the to get its attention but really mostly when you open your heart and you ask for the the blessings the connections the energy of air and water and fire and Earth and and and spirit to come to you and to help you achieve a life that's healthy and happy and meaningful right where where your purpose is revealed to you and shown to you and then the guidance is offered to you to find your path to that purpose and the way to embody that purpose the magic starts flowing the synchronicities happen right and the gifts appear and the unexpected manifest and you don't have to cast a spell because you're you're getting in harmony with the great magic the do open on their own all around you yeah so that's my approach to spellcasting and I wanted to try to capture that in this book and and so you're using it so you know so there traditional practices that I have sort of rephrased as spells but it's all it's all about the practice of opening your mind and your heart and your body to the flow of the magic of creation yeah it's all about participating and being within that and I you you said on your bio that you took a little time to Apprentice with Mother Earth and that's it's all about getting kind of reconnected and and just stepping into that flow you know magic is is participating in rather than controlling and and I think that's beautiful I mean you know it's not about not shaping you're not totally passive right you're not a stone in the river you know you're swimming in the river um yeah and you're allowed to pick a pick a goal you know and ask the river to help get you there and it will um I think one of the differences that I was sort of taught like and I and I think I have that language still in in witchcraft I use air and every once in a while it come out of my mouth and I'm like oh yeah that well because that was 20 years of training use water to cleanse and purify and now like nope not using that's the old exploitive you know um domineering extracting patri partner with right partner with air partner with water partner with Earth yes work with work with ask for what you need rather than demanding it's a different It's a reverential poster and I mean we're we're ancient but we're new right so and we don't have a sem well we do have a seminary but but we we have the teacher we have the same teacher as our ancestors we have Spirit we have and most particularly we have Spirit embodied by the natural world and when we ask it shows itself to us and it shows us how to live and it shows us it it shows us its magic so that was my yeah that was my time that I took off was to put down what I thought I knew put down the way that I used to practice bring myself into apprenticeship with creation and ask to be taught what I needed to know which is how we created The Witches wisdom tur by asking what is it that the world needs to know that other tarot decks haven't shared and and I used shamanic journeying as the method and the answers were really extraordinary and the deck really works and the presence the energy the benevolent Spirits most of them revealing themselves to us through Earth through the forms of creation is so it sees us as we are with all our flaws and Imperfections right which are massive at this stage of 5,000 years of a distorted right about who we are but it's so willing to bring us home to show us how to get there and that's what beautiful deck thank you and and I'm very excited that it's being re-released in a slightly smaller version I know some people like the smaller version but I love the different imagery on it that it's not your traditional it has reimagined some of these ideas to make it more rounder I'm not sure how to softer more more accepting more inclusive more beautiful uh I I'm it it's it's a very beautiful deck and so I'm I'm looking forward to getting it when it comes out and and re-release when is it being released thank you we should do another show in uh October the end of October perfect yeah so if you want the fancy Dancy one with the bag and the Magical box and all that stuff you got to get it now it'll be but it's going to be great because it's more accessible it's smaller which I know a lot of people will prefer I mean you're not supposed to riffle this deck it's really meant to be lifted and dropped which is why the good the big cards were cool because it kind of forced you to do it that way um but yeah the end of October smaller decks smaller books smaller box and smaller price so there you go many many more people to get it which will thrill me no end yeah the the I love that you called it rounder yeah there's there's something there's a quality to it that to me as a reader um it it's more maybe more feminine maybe softer I'm not sure but I I very much like it it's it's different but I I love it and so I'm looking forward to hopefully have getting both getting we're going to have both of them cuz I like the idea of the bigger deck that you drop it's a little different you know and and having something a little different is fun I love to hear that yeah it is a more feminine deck um not intentionally so although it's created by two women but the the energy the preeminent energy that came through was very maternal tough at times especially in the five cards we had no intention you know like oh the five cards will be no no we just kept asking what do we need to know what do you want to show us what do people need to know and and the deck appeared it it you know beautiful and the energy of it was there are uh non-binary figures who appeared there are men who appeared um and tons and tons of animals and spirits of elements that appeared but the overarching energy I would say is the en of Mother Earth of the divine feminine embodied by the natural world that sort of overarching Adam amundi and she was so compassionate and benevolent and generous truly maternal you know in the best sense of that word um and it and you know it wasn't I mean you know it's my voice and it's WR it's a written deck it's very different because it's really a written deck um and my voice is very present in that writing but but we were writing it together and and it's a much more benevolent presence than mine I'm not maternal I'm always say I'm breastplate not I love the uh the wheel card um in that deck um in some decks they call it the wheel of The Wheel of Fortune but that card is absolutely beautiful in this deck there's just something about it that just speaks to my core beautiful beautiful card I I am kind of tarot obsessed I have about 170 decks and there's something about that Wheel of Life card that just resonates deeply with me I'll tell Danielle she'll be very moved it's it's one of the most beautiful I mean there are tons and tons and tons of beautiful images but it's one of the most beautiful it's really powerful it's really evocative she captures the magic of each of the seasons as the wheel is turning um and it's yeah there's tons of of symbolism and messages and hidden magic in every illustration and and in the the writing there's a there there are spells you know as you're reading the copy where you see things rhyming there are spells going on so and you have to dig for it a you know you gotta be paying it if I put it there are there's a magic for every card and that's quite explicit but there are also these spells that are a little more hidden that you have to kind of work for to find them but they're there well now I definitely need this deck because Easter eggs are my thing give me a magical Easter egg I'm there so chall accepted challenge accepted you have to read for me at some point I want to have somebody else read for me with my absolutely 100% you know what I've been sitting here while we've been talking about it and and I pulled the card oh okay so what's the message and it's the pilgrim it's the P the pilgrim oh oh with a fox but Ila if you notice behind Phyllis she has a tapestry of the same exact card look at that wow talk about synchronicities and Journeys travel yeah I I am very excited about the connection here and the the earthiness of this card and just I what I'm seeing here with this and with you and with this doubling of the card is I just can't stop with the synchronicities I just keep seeing that there is there's more to this journey for you that will be revealed on the path that you are on a path that maybe even you don't know some of these new doors that are going to be opening up that some of the the adventures uh the not Adventures but more possibilities that are going to be coming for you in the near future I'm very excited to see where you'll go from here because I think you have some unexpected things and and the fox the trickster you know there's a little bit of wisdom here for you with that so I I'm curious to see where that goes me too one of the things about that fox there were four totems in that appeared in the deck and the fox appeared really early on was darting all over the place driving Danielle crazy because she's a Virgo she's like she wants the fox in a straight line I'm like I got a fox you know literally I got a four-legged Fox her name is Foxy and you that's not it drives my husband crazy when we try to take a walk because she's darting all over the place because your instinct catches the scent and knows which way to go and it isn't always an straight line right um and you have to allow yourself to be guided by things that aren't necessarily rational but right that are deeply instinctual and you have to trust the wisdom of your of your of your body the intuition is the Instinct of your M you know your your mental faculties instinct to me is very embodied it's that what your body knows um and yeah I like what you're saying and the the thing that I remind myself when I see that card in resp response to what you're saying is to remind myself and this was that that that maternal powerful benevolent energy that really surfaced in this card that what what she needs to know what I am being reminded of is that no matter what direction I choose no matter which way I go I am always supportive every time I put my foot down mother is beneath me to hold me up that the air I breathe what that everything I need to live is being given to me with abundance and generosity and that I'm safe I'm safe I'm guided I'm loved I'm I'm supported um and that that is how I should openheartedly move into the journey and accept the things that come up as they come up and and and just honestly look at them and accept them as they are and move forward with that knowing the whole time that you're in a good space and that you're supported and whichever direction you go whether it's zigzaggy or in a straight line that you have that support I love that now phis I I I do have one last question for you Leila is blessed to be able to to participate this year in the parliament of world religions um alongside uh all the the thousands of folks that'll be there um is there an opportunity for folks like me to support it or participate or get behind it in some way even though we physically cannot be in Chicago is there a way for us to be supportive oh that's such a thank you thank you thank you thank you so the answer is absolutely yes and there are a bunch of ways um you know I have my own patreon Community which is part of my support to be able to do this um and that's incredibly meaningful to me you can become a member of the parliament you can just sign up for the newsletter right and so you find out what's going on with the parliament but also what's going on locally um you can of course if people want to if they're in the Chicago area they can volunteer the way you did and it's 50 bucks and then you just put in a few hours every day and you're in right because it at this juncture I think it's it's a little more expensive I think it's 350 a person if you come with a group of 10 it's a little more if you're on your own but you can you can you can come for 50 bucks just do some work which is very Pagan you know um I'm very excited there we go and and you know it's it's a good way to do it and the other thing is that we will be announcing a day rate and a an online rate you won't be able to attend I mean there's 800 programs and there's ritual right SEC music night but we'll be streaming um all of the plenaries which are the major programs we'll be streaming um I believe the women's assembly and the two climate assembly so you get to participate in that which is some of the most important programming that we're doing those three assemblies um
