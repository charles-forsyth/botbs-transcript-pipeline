times you've got your ingredients you've got your verbiage you've got your your intentions all set to go but then what how do you give it that wolf how do you put it out there how do you eject your magic to a point where your magic will happen and that's what we're going to talk about today magic is more than just a recipe it's more than just putting all the ingredients to go  more than just saying what you want laid in your candle and then be done with it you actually have to power the spell to make what you want to happen happen you gave me flashbacks of microwave toaster oven versus cooking on the stove in the episode the different sources of energy that you can use and what it feels like to raise energy and how to direct its going to get into all sorts of things this is such a good topic that this is actually our second episode on raising energy for spell crafting for more info on this check out episode 51 from I don't even remember how long ago that was but it was a minute

Magic I think they have their festivals there but if you're interested I believe there are still tickets available it is an amazing time and I know that we're going to have one in particular that I know we're going to see Liz can't wait to see you there hey Liz my workshops for Sankofa are everyday almonds charm casting with ordinary objects and walking the winding path creating and using labyrinths in Magic and meditation my two workshops are going to be verbal cardio Mansi as well as appropriation vs. appreciation walking the witches line but what is a Yin without a yes what is Laverne without Shirley and what is shell with  Layla so I have kindly given her a nudge to join in on my workshops with me cuz you know two is better than one that's right there will be doing a radio show together and Frank wonderful head of the radio station there last year figured out how to put the station live on the web and so some of our listeners were able to listen to my radio show direct from Brushwood during the festival and this year Friday morning she'll and I from 11:50 will be doing a radio show I can't even first of all you know I tell you this all the time I hate listening to my own voice and who would have thought a I end up on a podcast that you have roped me into a radio show DJ like what is happening in my life I'm not sure who you even are anymore we actually put a call out for  I said give me some DJ names folks and we got some funny ones I am not going to lie but I haven't settled on one yet but it's got to be something catchy like I don't even know secret shell on the sound waves oh my God DJ sacred do I have like that but we did get some very fun cool funny DJ suggestion names I kind of like that one OK shells DJ name and pipe shelter o o s pronounce like shelter oh babe and put like a whole call sign for you so it would be like this shelter oh your hometown Salem witch putting the itch of the ass.  we also have a DJ named Michelle casting my hype they say is Layla she's been putting a spell on you and your little dog too since she was old enough to put salt rings on the roof get ready to get there which back in your witch hazel in your broom back in your Broom-Hilda brought to you by your two favorite which socks but even Witchiepoo herself would approve of now that I like DJ Layla bones I love it you love me that's so perfect thank you THB in 1971 so if you have any other ideas or if you want to vote on one of those for Shell if you have any ideas for Layla son of man you got it a few days left before our radio show know I am definitely going with that whole like a little paragraph thing even if I pick a different DJ because that's hysterical hysterical  I'm itchy ass hole that that was great but I'll have to see who wrote that and give them a shout out our listeners have missed future Layla so they're going to love that Layla is definitely going to put the link to the radio show in the show notes because if you can't make it to Brushwood you can still listen and it's fun because it's live and it won't just be us you can listen to all of the radio show is I believe they go from like 10 till 5 or 10 till 7 every day of the festival's so you'll be able to listen to all sorts of Music talk shows everything it's all run by volunteers and Frank so it is a lot of fun you get to listen to all types of music we're going to do a particularly witchy focused set for are free  a show I think you don't want to miss it all right so this episode again just kind of going to be a little bit of a very 2024 about how to raise energy how do you actually get a spell to work and I'm going to bring up Aleister Crowley again you know he does he was not a great person you love to hate him and hate to love him yeah he did have some very interesting ideas about magic he was very smart and one of the things he said magic is the science and art of causing change to occur in Conformity with the will and he capitalized the word will because that's the important part and will and intent are like the same thing but he also means by will your force your energy your life Forrest he felt that everything in the world wants to be  an alignment that everything has energies and that your will is your way of getting everything into alignment with your purpose with your path and that's really what you need power spells is gather your will your energy gather the will of other things and focus it into your intent damn that Crowley City guy still a weirdo so let's move on from Crowley but that is the basis of magic in our last episode about this episode 51 you know we did talk about a varying amount of methods you could use to raise energy and what works for you might be different for the next person you know how you feel that energy flow through you or you know maybe you don't feel energy flowing through you if it's drumming or maybe you don't feel it if it's chanting or meditating so just because we talk  either in the previous episode of this episode different things are going to work for different people depending on how you feel that energy and that's a really excellent point because it also is going to depend on your modality of magic like right where do you Source your energy shell and I do a lot of combination it's mostly our own will but we also draw energy from an animistic forest from the Earth from other things we work with the energies that are all around us another modality is Spirit driven a lot of people will power their spouse with spirit Spirit guides ancestors and go with that energy strictly shell and I also work with that energy and there's other mental energies as well that you can use psychological energies there's chaos magic do depending on your magic modality will also depend on how you raised him father sent to you as well another point is there are people that have a very hard  time with visualization and for whatever reason it's just not something they're they're able to do easily so you know some of these methods might not work for them are as chanting singing dancing may be their preferred method because it's something physical and you know when you're drumming you feel that drum beat in your car or you know when you're chanting or singing you're feeling that in those vibrations go through you as you sing and chant so what is your best method is going to be different and you're going to have to kind of try and I guess all to figure out where do you best feel that energy flowing through you exactly and in this episode we're going to talk to you a lot about how to feel it like in the other episode we did talk about some different exercises and things that you could do to raise energy this episode we want to focus  moron Basics how do you feel that energy what can you do to actually feel the magical energy and then start to work with it from there so we're going to talk about a few different things and first I want to make sure that you know what energy were talking about internal energy can feel like strong emotions when you're so excited that you feel like your body is buzzing when you're so mad that you feel like you might explode you're so happy that you feel a glow emanating from inside you when you stare at someone to get them to look at you or have you ever had a hunch and had to be right more often than I care to admit that's all internal energy outside energy feels more like have you ever walked into a room and felt the tension even though no one was saying anything or been near a person or group of people and just been like a dick or someone that drains your energy even though they seem perfectly fine you're just always drained after work or someone who always seemed  to make you feel up and energize or a good one for us have you ever been to a festival or a concert and just felt those waves of energy and excitement coming off the crowd that is energy that is Magic that is power that you can use if you know how to tap into it and if you know how to raise it so think of those feelings I wanted to kind of just start with chanting and I know that we did talk about that and the previous episode but there's a couple chance that you know I learned these things way back in the nineteen hundreds and I don't know if it's because we did it a lot or if they just resonated so deep but it's almost like now you know decades on if I get into a Zone and start these chance that cone of power is almost like instantly there and you know I guess what she can't you pick is going to depend on what your purpose  or maybe you have a particular chant you do every time but I do have two that were probably my most favorite that we used whether it was in our community in Upstate New York or if it was in our old coven or if it was just a bunch of us in our friends doing something and I think the two that have stuck with me the most we all come from the goddess I do remember that you're going to make me sing it we all come from the guy and to her we shall return the ring to the ocean come from the God we are the two most fearsome real singers in the show description the other one is I don't know what it might have been because it's about which I know you  and those are chance that we're not unique to our community those everywhere so if you learn those chance and the thing with chance is repeated words are powerful working with words and with breath to raise energy is something that people have been doing since there have been people I find Habit to be the easiest way to kind of get there for lack of a better a better way to say it you know to get into that space to get into Alpha raising energy the whole bet you know repetition has a purpose I think and breathwork does as well and in Hinduism and Buddhism there's this idea of Prana Breath of Life and so chanting you're using that Breath of Life that is powerful in itself so you're adding words that have power words like those  Champs that we just said have been repeated over and over again by Earth worshiping goddess and God worshiping pagans and heathens so they have this power of repetition and of History you can also make up a chant I'd make one up I was thinking about an exercise that people could do to work with brass and with chance that they can actually feel that energy pick one of those chance or I wrote one that's really short and dark of night The Witches Hour I call my guys and raise my power I love them it's really short it's really Punchy again I like rhyming shit start with a whisper and you don't have to say it just whisper it  I call my guys and I just keep gradually getting louder and louder and louder more volume more power in dark of night The Witches Hour I called my guys I raise my power and dark of night The Witches Hour I call my guys I raise my power and just keep going with that literally like a physical representation of the voice in the brass and the the sound and the voice all of it works together and you'll start to feel that physically you might feel yourself moving rhythmically because your body is starting to get involved and raise that energy and so just keep repeating that as you feel the energy the more you feel it the louder you get then once you get the energy up the idea is to gather it and in the previous episode I talked about Gathering that you're Spencer a ball at your Center or another easy way especially with a chant is very often you can hold something in your hands like a crow  Dolores small statue and as you're champing push that energy into the object that you're holding and then you can hold on to that and use it in a l Spell the same exact thing with drumming all the way up to the point of holding something in your hand so you know to direct that because obviously you're driving with drumming you know start that slow beat and as you make it louder make it faster and you know as you're going louder and faster same concept erasing that at some time in the past what we've done is kind of your your almost going so fast and so hard you almost like don't even know what your hands are doing anymore and then it just poop and he almost collapsed for lack of a better word and sometimes we have physically collapsed physical exertion that mental exertion all of that is energy  all of that is power that you can use to power your spouse no Lele you talked about a minute ago that you can say hold a crystal in your hand and directed into that then what what if you are just raising energy to store it into an object like a crystal to use for a later day then we know we have done this with alter tools we have done this with stones and crystals so I gather up all my energy let's say full moon in all we at we have a full moon going on this week and I want to take that full moon energy take some of this powerful energy going out and about my own energy energy from the earth and I want to put it in will say a quartz crystal  so I have this energy in that Crystal and now next week I end up wanting needing having to do a spell how can I utilize the energy in that Crystal in my spell that's a week from now now you've basically created a battery you can do with knots you can do crystals are great because they have that Matrix you can do with anything metal that you can pretty much do with anything but some items hold energy better than others so now you have a crystal battery that you have charged with the energy of Love or happiness or luck or anger or whatever you have charged it with so now you're doing a love spell and you grab the rose quartz that you have practice raising love energy with and it's full so now when you do your raising energy you ask that item hey Rose Quartz give me that energy back that I charged you with so now when you're doing your spell you have all that extra energy from that Crystal that you can then  raw into you add it to the other energy that you're raising now your spell is that much more powerful question this is a left turn and obviously I know the answer but that's not the point of this we have in Random episodes and people all over the Facebook and The Tick Tock talk about put all your shit out under the full moon or or in the Sun and get that sun energy and get that full moon energy I'm saying you know you Gathering the energy so are we saying that it is the same concept and then you can utilize that energy later you're saying exactly that you put your crystal out on the full moon this week and then maybe on the new moon you want need have to to do a spell you can utilize that Crystal and the  gee that you would go and you lie so that later but you still going to have to put your own energy into it the concept of energy everything has energy all things have energy all people have energy plants crystals Stones the Earth the Sun the moon everything everything has energy songs have energy you know emotion is energy so you don't have to just use the energy that's in your physical body some of us start right off the bat being able to do whether magic and change the color of our hair was just so sick of our wrist not really but it would be nice to go and floated down gently but others of us have to work at that we have to train ourselves just like you do with any sport you train yourself to have more energy reserves and to be able to gather more  however even those powerful which isn't just going to reach into themselves to pull out this energy they're going to have Spell components that lend their energy they're going to have spell batteries that they have charged with energy they're going to draw on the energy of the their land Spirits their ancestors and guides they're going to draw on the energy of the earth beneath them that they have created a relationship with drawn the energy of the sun they're going to ask Tecate to bring her energy in and they're going to leave that energy into their working so how do we do that we need to differentiate our energy and pull in other energy how do you like to Paul energy in from other sources not just a battery well I think it's going to depend on what I'm doing and what I'm adding to it if I'm just doing something with a handful of crystals that's going to be a little different than a  I'm pulling energy from herbs you know with crystals I'm going to put it in my hands I'm going to feel it you know I'm going to have a sexy time with my crystal you know you do you kind of like merge my energy with the energy in the Crystal and almost brings that visually in in my mind trying to pull that out of the Crystal and into me but then I may have my athame that I have charged which is more I'm not pulling the energy from it but using it as an extension of my hand oh you just brought up two awesome points but I totally have to okay all right so first thing that you said was visualize and that is a huge part of energy and even if you can't visualize even if you if you think in words like some of us to you  still use those ideas visualizing what you want visualizing the energy Imagining the energy creating that idea in your mind is very powerful and will work and you can feel the energy move so visualization and visualization exercises are extremely important and was that practice does make perfect so you just got to keep practicing the other thing that you said that I absolutely love his tools can be used not only to store energy but to direct it and how often do you see like a magician with a wand or a staff or an athame because those are excellent tools to Direct Energy I happen to have this this little wand that I got one of my local Salem stores and generally for most ritual purposes I like my wand to be made of wood I personally prefer Willow but this one I used for different things  and this is completely made of crystals it is a labradorite main base it's got a point quartz crystal on the bottom and then it's got a sphere quartz crystal on the top and then if I don't know eight little different colored ones down the base of it this would be something because it's all made out of stones and crystals that I would use more to direct energy than say my metal half May that's just amazing because I kind of feel that more in a crystal than I do in a metal and also a crystal is more likely to be able to amplify especially that one in particular is designed to amplify energy and has all the chakra colors going down. The quartz crystal at the end sign to channel your energy and amplify it where as just a metal athame is more the scientist to wrecked it in your energy  think of the tip like a laser pointer channeling all the energy that you've gathered and shooting it like an arrow to your goal and kind of when I think of my wand that's made out of the willow I feel that not that it can't Direct Energy and in what not but I just feel that I get more more out of out of this Crystal one just because it's Crystal in that would you know what I mean I mean I'm not knocking would no pun intended but I feel this is specifically designed in my opinion to be directing energy when I need to do that part of the reason for that is a lot of people believe and I'm one of them that magical energy acts a lot like electricity or water when you're directing electricity crystals can amplify electricity and amplify that light and make it react in all sorts of interesting beautiful ways so you can direct it and amplify it with a crystal metal electricity runs straight down metal not a  find it but it's running straight through it and write out the point and that's what you want to do with your energy and a spell as you want to concentrate it and run it straight out a point directly to your purpose and an athame I want to help you do that now would is not an excellent conductor of electricity but water and electricity can flow along that you can still use that to direct your will and to Direct Energy is going to feel different it's going to be more earthy it's going to be more slow it's going to be more malleable like a willow again that like-for-like sympathetic magic because it's rooted in the ground that Willow Branch still remembers being a tree and so it remembers being part of Mother Earth and being part of that energy so it's going to have a little bit of a different feel to it you should meditate and visualize with each of your tools with you can kind of get an idea of how the energy feels for you but then once you find what works for you  you know you may get all of the same thing inside of that Willow Wind that I get out of the Crystal limed and you know you may be more of that Earth the ground type of person where is I'm kind of like that electric charge just waiting to burst do you know and I kind of need that Crystal to not only direct it but also kind of add to it and that's why I like assembling a team that's why intention and will is totally enough but I love working with a team I like having my tools around me helping add their energy to my working I think it just makes it so much more beautiful to weave those energies together once you start working a lot of your tools in this manner it's almost like they become an extension of you or like an old friend they're no longer a thing on your  alter or anything on your shelf for a thing on your desk you start forming a personal relationship with these tools and the better that relationship is the easier everything I think it is to work with flow together and come together in this succinct beautiful magical working relationships and one of the ways to do that is to practice raising energy and directing it with your tools cuz you can do that without necessarily having a spell in mind or in the middle of a ritual you know you can you can work with indirect just as a kind of an exercise to get that practice to create that relationship in to learn what ways of raising works best for you try six or seven or eight different methods  before you feel what flower is best through you know the energy that were talking about you can feel it as a motion you can feel it as physical exertion I you can feel it as mental energy have you ever taken a test and felt completely drained afterwards yeah yeah because you were using all that mental energy that's energy you can use the power spell I know we have done this have you ever been in a group of friends and you just start laughing so hard that you can't stop and as soon as one of you stops you look at each other and start laughing all over again and you never really seemed to know why you might have even forgotten why but that infectious energy is passing around the whole group making everyone laugh and excited and happy that's magic that's energy you can harness and you can feel it quite hot rage and and we know she'll needs to not direct that it people in traffic because it causes problems  you know I try to be good I tried to be good or another good way to think about how that energy feels as if you ever been in the zone have you ever been completely vibing with something that you're doing you're doing sports and everything is working perfectly you're creating something and it just everything falls into place perfectly in the zone and everything is going so good that's a magical place that is energy you're in the flow of energy right there and those feelings if you remember those feelings you can use those to raise that energy in your body is incredibly potent sex will get you into that place if you're doing it right anything physical anything that you truly enjoy doing singing chanting like we were talking about earlier can get you into that sensation and that's where the magic is that's where the energy is that I have raised energy in the past so you know I love my Spotify  I do I love that sometimes it'll randomly come up and I'm like oh my God  play the playlist blend but as a lot of us to do I kind of have one playlist that's kind of just which you know I got my I got my stuff and sometimes that music can be an energy razor and I guess you have to really be kind of a music person to get it but if you set your playlist just right you can use music to be that energy razor on there I promise you'll feel some energy I mean I've been mad before I listen to some angry music and it really wasn't productive cuz it just kind of expanded my anger or happy unless some happy music makes you happy or you're sad and you listen to sad music and it makes you sad or same concept and so I have curated a witchy playlist that  I could use to get to that energy racing space if I needed to might need to rearrange a few songs you know I can I can use that as well if you're not a singer you know maybe you're embarrassed sang even to yourself or even around yourself maybe you're too self-conscious to dance curator playlist start with maybe slow easy meditative music before you get to the Raging drumming music but whatever it takes to get there with the options of raising energy are only limited to your mind stopping you one of my favorite ways to feel energy into practice raising energy actually came from one of our coven meets back in the day your ex he used to talk about his hands he would say his hands turned on you know I was worried you were going to take this down a sexual past but note the gotta ruin my ex has  send love you she would talk about his hands turning on and what he meant was sometimes and we would talk about magical energy without even realizing it he would start to raise energy and he could feel it in the center of his hands his palms but start to get hot you feel the heat of that energy raising right there I use this because I can feel it right now just talking about it I can feel it it's such an easy way to raise and Direct Energy that I used it as a basis as an exercise for my student so what you do think of a bubble bath or doing the dishes and you have lots and lots of Suds big piles of little tiny sudsy bubbles imagine in your head again we're getting into a little bit of visualization here but just think about all these bubbles the time in your life when you had the biggest piles of bubbles in front of you ever blows up in your hands and then switch them so your hands are almost in a prayer position Palm to Palm finger to finger but about an inch apart from each other and imagine that between them you have a lair  bubble bubble soap now move your hands in and out real quick just about an inch or so in front of your face and you can feel that energy between them you can feel the warmth and you can almost feel those soap bubbles between your hands if you're having trouble feeling it make us think of Bubbles and do it with real bubbles and then try it again without them but practice that focus on that so you can feel your palms get warm and you can feel the energy you can feel those soap bubble energy almost like the air is thick between your hands and practice until you can bring your hands really far apart and still feel that energy bouncing back and forth between them and keep practicing until you can turn your hands on and off at will and this is the energy of your body that you are drawing up bringing through your arms and pushing into your palms Reiki Masters to the site you're into Reiki shall I know this is something you know how to do so this is an exercise that you can do to help you feel that energy and learn to draw and direct it into your  and then into a small space and since you had to bring up how I am knowledgeable of this since I was first hand to him doing this frequently I can give you some insight or two you know we've talked about how we have gotten ourselves to a point that we can you know do a few things and in within a minute or so be an alpha I will say that he kind of snapped himself into Alpha first and then they would kind of turn on and one thing he would kind of do at the end not really like a clap but almost kind of like his hands together and then pull them apart and that kind of broke and it off Alpha Park kind of throwing himself into Alpha in the beginning I'm not saying it was key to it but it definitely didn't hurt you know you're kind of focusing your getting your you're getting in that magical mental space  he doing that magical mental stuff and getting into that magical mental space is not a necessary part but it really does help another tool in your toolbox exactly exactly so we talked about how to feel the energy how to raise the energy directing the energy to your purpose is the next step is the last step how do you direct it to your purpose and we talked a little bit about the cone of Power are using an athame or a want and the reason for that is because again sympathetic magic the doctrine of signatures says that if you want to direct a spell to a purpose specific point and you should point that it you should throw an arrow to it you should point out it with a pointer you should point out it with your wand so take all of your energy like a cone bigger at the bottom you're Gathering it all in and then you're directing it to a single-purpose your will your intent that one point and you're throwing all of that energy to that point  letting it go and go off and take care of what you've told it to do and you know that's where sometimes thing is like you know if you wrote something on a bay leaf for example you can raise that energy and then directed into that bay leaf and then do whatever you're going to do with it burn it slowed it whatever but you know having that focal point but if you don't have a focal point you know maybe maybe your smile is something like you know you're trying to do to gain prosperity in your life and maybe it's just more of a directing your energy and your focus out to the universe you know your call to the universe for this site what specific but not too specific thing so you know who have an object or what have you took to direct it in that's fabulous but if you don't  you can also direct your what I what I do is direct you're asked out to the universe send it to the universe that's or send it to your deity or your guys are your ancestors to whoever or whatever to work you're well there's been times when even my buddy list of the time when you are so mad have you ever been so pissed off the rage just builds up in you until you just have to scream and you scream it out to the universe and then you can take a big breasts and you're calmer and you're a little more centered you just threw a whole bunch of energy to the universe why are you telling people what I did last week telling all your secrets shall everyone so that's what you're doing and to spell it hopefully it's not always rage but whatever energy you're raising it's that same type of feeling your building and building and building it and it has to have a release of some  so your release is burning something so that the energy can go off to the universe or to your ancestors or maybe you're singing in your clapping at the end and pushing or maybe your we talked in an old episode about putting all of that energy into an eggshell jar an eggshell jar spell and then physically throwing it while you're releasing the energy so the kinetic energy matches the spell energy in your physically throwing it you know that's what you want to kind of visualize or actually do to get that energy out out of you and working towards your spell goal but as much as is you're doing that you still after you've done all of these said things want to ground and Center to release any residual energy that you may be carrying because if you don't think of like a live wire that's come down in a storm and it's just kind of flaw  turn around in the road because they're still electricity pumping through it even though it's broke its connection that's kind of how you are until you ground and sent her and that can really mess with you you don't want to be that Untamed Livewire that's just out of control energetically and you also conversely you don't want to have put so much of your own energy into this and so much energy and so much of your own physical and mental and psychic energy that now your depleted now you're tired now you're cranky now you're sore both of those are possible after you've done a working like literally go eat something have bread and cheese have a favorite at the end eating something doing something ordinary and mundane house bring you back to the physical helps bring you back to a center but you can take it one step further as well and literally ground release that energy and  picture yourself coming to a balance so release the energy into the Earth imagine it flowing back up into you until you are refreshed and renewed and in perfect balance of the most you know I am a food lover I like food and a lot of traditional covens and working groups and in sometimes just individual solo practitioners follow the concept of kind of the cakes and Ale at the end of a ritual or at the end of my coven I love when it comes out you just said cakes and ale so my my lovely cousin you know we we do the cakes and Ale I'm going to call him cuz that's just what I call him according to Raymond Buckland Big Blue Book and somewhat, and we can Circle cakes in a list of ritual name given to the food and drink that you have to close out your spell original it was  vital part of any magical working and is supposed to Aid in properly grounding and centering you eating food is an easy way to remind you that you have a body and are part of the physical world generally you know it's like so there was this one time while the person who was bringing the cornbread last-minute couldn't come to the ritual did any of us think of that no so here we are and we're like oh shit we need our cornbread and the closest we could find Fritos corn chips and because honey is a part of our personal rituals honey barbecue Fritos corn chips oh my God here we are you not drizzling honey I'm corn chips I'm about to good to eat to ground at the end of the ritual and can I tell you it was the most delightful snack we ever invented  to all my apps in Salem we are the inventors of corn chips dipped in Honey that's kind of hilarious each of us took a bite we're like huh but yeah so I'm a big food grounding person we talked to in other episodes of in our own community and in our old Cotton how we would physically go down to the ground at the end of raising in and putting out the energy we would physically touch the ground and talk about releasing any access at 2 and then coming to a balance and then we would go eat there would be Feast afterward bring all sorts of food and everyone would face after just socializing and feasting just doing ordinary mundane things there's something about digesting food I guess he's been digesting that helps bring you back to your body from that magical place it brings you back from the Hedge you come back to the this world and food really helps with that however you eat it even if it's weird  Fritos and honey whatever it happens to be at can help a lot I feel like putting food and drink and you put you back into reality you know because when you're in the alpha State and when you're in that magical place you are in a different reality and food and drink are not a part of that you are all-powerful God a warrior queen you are moving the energies of the universe and of life itself you don't need to eat your an all-powerful being but show likes corn chips and honey yeah yeah so you start waving corn chips and honey and all the sudden you go from powerful Warrior which back to Shell before we go visualization exercise that you can use to help you Direct Energy and this involves schedule work for symbol work isn't  so pick a symbol or a schedule that you would like to charge it can even be a physical object but I prefer something mental so think of an image think of a heart okay you're going to self love spell so think of the image of a heart so get yourself into a nice meditative space and you're going to do what's called box breathing and Breath Again is a really good way to help you connect with your own energy and what box breathing is if you breathe in for a count of four hold your breath for a count of four breathe out for a count of four and then hold your breath again before I count to 4 and then keep doing that focus on your breath while you're doing the Box breathing in your mind I think of a heart start constructing a heart just a symbol of a heart and once you're able to construct the image of the heart start filling it with the energy that you feel coming up from your core as you're doing this box breathing feel that heart with the energy  picture it getting more and more clear in your mind whatever symbol you have picked once you've done that then hold that image in Your Mind release it to the universe with your intent in this case self-love and then bring yourself back to Center focusing on visualizing an image and pushing your energy into that image is a good way to learn how to power symbols I like so I've been trying to get more into sigils I think I was afraid of him cuz I'm so not see but I like that every day you did have a feeling you're going to make one of my things I love when I'm out and I like to make a schedule for my day every single day so of course I'm going to drag you into it we should do henna sigils used to do henna all the time you were like the  master I was just your canvas looks like a preschooler but I've had a lot of fun with it and I appreciate that all right so practice practice practice raising energy feeling that energy and directing that energy and using that in your spell work is what's really going to make them work that's where the power comes so when you are creating your spouse or if you are utilizing a spell that was created by someone else remember this is the key it's not just following the pages in the directions in the posts online there has to be that energy raising in directing or the rest is just words so hopefully you will all be able to try some of these out and see how they work for you see what works best for you like we said in the beginning  I guess when your physical movement maybe it's going to be chanting singing drumming be something we didn't think of yeah however you prefer to raise energy you're going to have to practice it and try a few different ways and see what works best so I really hope that you all take this opportunity to piece together the last three episodes and if you haven't tried to create a spell or or to implement a spell I hope this gives you the courage and the info to do so and if it does tell us all about it you know how to get us on the socials are months of your spellcrafting summer and hopefully these last three episodes have given you a basis to do all sorts of magical workings between now and September so we will
