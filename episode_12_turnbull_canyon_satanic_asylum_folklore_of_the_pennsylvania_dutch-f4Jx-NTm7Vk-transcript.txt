chugs for you Tom and Mike yeah thanks guys which I feel bad because I totally forgot to tell them about my whole Turkey Hill thing we'll have to tell them next time we see them next time we're on their podcast for sure you know this week has been crazy not the least because of what's going on in the world and I know we're not exactly that kind of podcast but you have to be living under a [ __ ] rock maybe the one that broke and released all the demons for real oh my God I read that and I was like when when stuff like that starts to happen shit's about to get real people right I saw that demon Rock thing that Japanese killing stone that was supposed to contain an evil Fox Spirit yeah that broke now now what what's the deal this was like what a couple a couple thousand years ago this fox succubus type entity was wreaking havoc and and killing all across the land with its demonic pleasures and then got like what encompassed into this stone for all of eternity is that kind of the gist of it so the legend goes it's called the sesos ski or the killing Stone because anyone who touches the stone apparently dies it's supposed to be the corpse of a beautiful woman who is actually a nine-tailed fox demon called tamamo n the Stone's located in the toiki prefecture near Tokyo Legend has it that a couple was walking along minding their own business in the forest When They Came Upon a baby lying on the ground they took the baby in because really what are you going to do leave a baby on the ground they named her to Mama n and they raised her as their own child as she grew the family realized that their adopted daughter was exceptional in every way she was extremely bright well spoken beautiful and she was even chosen to read poetry before the emperor the emperor took her into his household as a servant and she grew into a beautiful and knowledgeable young woman everyone thought she was the best at everything she was the most beautiful the most well-dressed the best mannered she could even answer the most difficult questions any Court scholar could come up with she caught the eyes of everyone including the pervy elderly Emperor who decided to make her his consort they seemed to be happy until the emperor suddenly became ill as he grew sicker and sicker tamama n seemed unbothered she didn't care they brought in doctor after doctor to no avail the court brought in a sorcerer who said that the emperor was sick because of an evil spirit the court Scholars then brought in priests from all across the land to pray for the emperor's Health but nothing worked he just continued to get sick the sorcerer came back and performed another spell he then determined that it was actually a demon that was causing the emperor's sickness and that demon was none other than tamamo n the sorcerer did another spell to reveal her and she appeared as the nine-tailed fox Spirit oh wow and it was discovered that she had been sucking the life out of the emperor and that was what was causing his illness all the Warriors tried to kill her and she fled the palace Legend says that she was taken down by an arrow to the throat and that her body turned to stone that stone became the Sosi and anyone who touches it dies oh [ __ ] another ending to The Legend is a little bit more hopeful it says that many me many years later a monk came to the stone to hear her side of the story tamama n told him that she had been cursed as a baby and that was why she had been abandoned but she loved her parents and was growing up kind and strong and beautiful with a good spirit despite the curse however her father had been falsely accused and thrown in jail by the emperor and that caused her to give it in to the demon within because of the Revenge that filled her spirit she promised to the monk to never hurt another human and he released her spirit from the stone and since then no one was killed if they touched it so that's what I heard what does the fox say I couldn't help myself and it also um from what I read it it seemed for almost like a visual peace of mind there were leather straps around the stone as well almost kind of like symbolically holding the demon in the Rock like what the [ __ ] happened because this [ __ ] just cracked overnight and it's broken yeah they were saying there were signs in February that it was starting to break and the straps had given away as well now you could say that time weather you know just the natural course of of time happening you know I am not very well versed in in the climate in Japan but I would imagine you know you get a little crack some some water gets in there gets icy expands you know and that happens over hundreds of years okay I can see the ra The Rock will crack open these are some superstitious times we live in and coincidences I it's just I don't believe in coincidences so much and this is kind of a spooky coincidence why now Betty White the last golden girl holding closed the Demonic Gates she dies now this rock that's holding a demon down it breaks yeah so you'd have to be living under that rock to not know what's going on in Ukraine right now and you know if if I W if I was a a a Christian lean in person I would I would start to be looking for the four horsemen at this point everyone is afraid right now things are pretty scary and there's a lot of stuff going on and and and some of it has has signs and no matter what your religious belief is or what your faith is there's things going on right now when you add The Coincidence of say this demon Rock bursting open and this fox demon succubus being Unleashed coincidentally at the same time shit's going down in in Europe it it's just these coincidences kind of way heavy you know I kind of joke about the whole apocalyptic thing but you know no matter what your belief system is there's signs and read the news it's there and it's frightening and we don't try to take a political or a a deep heavy turn on anything here but when you are a a magical spiritual type person you're seeing signs separate and apart from what the news is spewing to you and then you add the spew from the news I don't know it it it's it's unsettling but that kind of that kind of leads us into you know maybe something that is more more our Jam there's some magic going on in the Ukraine there is and the strength and the resiliency of the people has been astounding to see and at the end of our podcast if you look in the show notes we will definitely have um some vetted places where you can donate uh if you want to give some help to the refugees or the people in Ukraine we've all heard the stories of some of the absolutely amazing courage and bravery that these people have in defending their Homeland against this you know everyone heard about the the warship you know the Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island [ __ ] you Russian warship yeah you know and that's that's kind of become a rallying cry and on a on a pagan level on a witchy level some of the the Pagan and the folklore and the the witchy curses that have been coming out have been beautiful and heartening to see the Ukrainian woman that went up to the soldier there's even video of her that you can find where she goes up to the soldier and basically tells him [ __ ] you why are you here and then tells him to put these sunflower seeds in his pockets so that at least his useless body will grow sunflowers in her land after he dies she cursed him she cursed that that that man yeah she even told him from this moment you are cursed I'm telling you this woman gave zero [ __ ] she was like here you go [ __ ] take these seeds so at least your body will provide nourishment to our national flower when you die you know if if if you strip away the whole war and what's going on right now from that I love the fact that in the year 20202 there is someone somewhere still cursing a [ __ ] who has done her wrong right that that warms my heart and call me sick and twisted but I appreciate the fact that Witchcraft and Magic is still happening all day every day all across the world I love that you know they might not want to call it that but Witchcraft and Magic is happening all day every day and I love it and I know that's going to be the focus of your story later we're going to talk about folklore and Magic that kind of survives right now even like you said we might not necessarily call it magic but that's still what it is and I think in Ukraine like you you and I both kind of have found out lately this is it's alive and well and it's much more accepted and there's some and again I know you're going to talk about it later there's some places here in the US where that kind of ingrain folklore magic is just part of the air that we breathe that we don't even necessarily think about right right but yeah before we get into that before we get into that let's lighten it back up and I want to know what you're smoking today I am smoking some homegrown and a little also a little bit of some delivery from the gas station the gas station you know I love my guys at the gas station they were out of shatter I was sad they do not sell I just want people to know they don't sell gas there but they do sell gas they totally sell gas not for your not for your car though right right right so we're both right they do not sell petrol and a little bit of Georgia pie o yummy yummy but you know it doesn't taste like Georgia pie and it doesn't taste like Girl Scout cookies and that just saddens me no it doesn't the Georgia pie is really tasty I have to say say it's good stuff um it does have I would say a sweet taste to it and a very uplifting high for sure it gives me um you know sometimes you get kind of like that not couch lock but kind of vibrating nice body feeling um along with a with a good high so I would say it's it's definitely something for when I want to be able to work relaxed but focused so you can you can still function but in a comfortable manner exactly so it's great for when I'm editing or when I need to be singularly focused on something with ADHD I tend to get easily distracted and I'm bouncing from one side quest to another trying to get things done but sometimes a a hybrid like this one allows me to stay in the moment kind of you know I feel uplifted I've got some good music going but I can really focus on either my research or my editing and so I like it for podcasting and things like when I'm trying to work I uh I I got some grape Diamond today oh that sounds delicious it is although it does have a purple Hue it does in no way shape or form taste like grape oh no I want this [ __ ] to tastes like like the oldfashioned like Hubba Bubba grape bubblegum that's my expectation if it tastes that intense it's added tpin which you know as long as they tell you that they added tpin for flavor isn't necessarily a bad thing it doesn't taste like grape though but it's good it is purple and I do love a purple strain it's pretty it's pretty like I almost feel like I I feel bad lighting it on fire oh it's that pretty yeah I do like growing pretty strains it's very much a a head high I could totally get up and function in like Mass clean right now sometimes those strains that give you like the head high can be a little bit too much in the head for some people whether you have anxiety or not sometimes it can be a little too head hi High have you noticed any of that here you know I do think that that is kind of a person to person um Case by case personality to personality I am I am a Gemini both of [Laughter] me so I can kind of be all over the place and function properly just because I'm a Gemini and that's my personality I can kind of get through that and not have an issue with that whereas someone who tends to be maybe of a different type of of Personality might not be able to cope with that super intense head high you know what I mean yeah that's an excellent point shell I think it's personality based you know what what type of person are you I agree I absolutely agree and that's something that um you know you can take the effects of something and I know breaking it down to sativa and indica is way too simplistic but it's the language that we know right now and it's the best way that we have at the moment to describe things but just because you know that a sativa tends to make some people anxious and in your head that's not to say that that's exactly how it's going to affect you I think one mistake people make though is they'll try something and it won't work for them and they assume every other thing is going to affect them the same exact way and it's not exactly there's so many differences like you and I have talked about reaching for the high THC reflexively and that's not always going to work for me or you or anybody sometimes you need that very low THC and high C CBD flour or sometimes you're going to need something that that has different properties and THC isn't necessarily the one that's going to work for you and you can try so many different things maybe smoking flour isn't for you maybe you want to to dab a concentrate or maybe you want to use a type of vaporizer or dry Vape the herb there's so many different ways to do it maybe you need an edible it's amazing how many things this miraculous plant can help with and just to have fun with hang out with your friends with yeah I mean you know you have fun your back doesn't hurt win-win for me it's my back I know it's not your back you have other things no today I am painfree and I am smoking just for the sheer enjoyment of it and hanging out with my bestie exactly woohoo yay and I have a story for you what is your story so I was thinking about you coming out here to visit and and I was thinking about how we've been talking about folklore specific to places lately and so I started to look into local Legends and folklore around here I did find a spot brimming with creepy tals that's not too far from me at all called Turnbull Canyon and you know as I was looking into it I I was quite surprised to hear that something called the landlocked Bermuda Triangle oh yeah also called a gateway to Hell in a psychic black hole was about an hour away from me how fun is all of those things I love them let's go I'm always the person who's like let's do it let's go to it yes and these are three fun things all rolled into one so it's down here in sunny Southern California and it's over near the Foothills it's in actually the foothills of the palamar mountains which is just about 20 miles east of Los Angeles so is this like desert or something it is desert but the Foothills are a little more um verdant there's water there and there's a spot called turnball Canyon and Turnbull Canyon has a dark and kind of shitty history much like a lot of places that were contested when people came out west this has kind of a a bloody history and it's one of the few places in the desert that has water so let's start with the 1800s the Quakers you know we talked about different people moving West when we were talking about Joshua tree and the Mormons this is the Quakers coming West in the 1800s and they moved into the Southern California area and they found the perfect spot to make a settlement it was in the desert so gorgeous spot oceans of 30 miles away to the West Foothills just to to the east of them but they had no water so they looked to this spot called Turnbull Canyon owned by well it wasn't called that at the time it was a valley near them owned by a gentleman named Robert Turnbull and he owned all the rights and he grazed sheep in this Valley the Quakers approached him several times over the years but Robert was a well-known drunk not very pleasant and wasn't very interested in selling but he was always interested in hearing how much money they might possibly offer him for this land finally years and years later they offered him $30,000 and this is in the 1800s that's so that translates to like a [ __ ] ton of money now exactly so they paid offered him $330,000 which is about half of what they had paid for this huge area that they had bought for their town which was nearby and it was an enormous amount of money and of course he accepted because he's greedy so they move in they get their water and the Quakers named it Turnbull Canyon in honor of him and they named their town which he would not have been welcome in because he was a drunk and they were Quakers they named the town uh Whittier after the Quaker poet John Green Leaf Whittier which is like the perfect name for a poet I think he's a poet and he didn't even realize it right he was born a poet Green Leaf Whittier so they named the town Whittier and they named the valley turnball after the man who had been kindly enough to sell it to them Robert spent the next few years getting drunk and being in and out of jail and one day he was um getting absolutely shitfaced in his favorite place the St Charles Hotel down in La when he couldn't sit on his bar stool or walk in a straight line he decided it was time to go home and he hops on his horse and commits the 1800s version of drunk driving tries to get home on his horse falls off in front of a police officer my question on that real quick is isn't this kind of like today's version of like the Tesla that can drive itself can't the horse kind of drive itself horse isn't drunk he was so freaking drunk all he had to do is stay in the freaking saddle and the horse would have taking him home but no he fell off in front of a cop so he falls off and the cop's like oh no your ass is going to jail hauls him off puts him in jail for the night wow the next day he gets out of jail and heads home and his housekeeper notices that he is battered and bloody and he explains to his friends that come over that he must have been kind of Rowdy and loud in the jail and somebody probably punched him a little bit to shut his ass up knocked him out and when he woke up the next morning they let him out he went home so his friends are trying to tell him dude drinking is going to kill you this is bad but of course Robert Turnbull is not gonna listen doesn't care loves his drink no [ __ ] given exactly no [ __ ] turnball decides you know he's going to rest up and feel better later that evening his housekeeper notices him acting strangely he's stumbling around you know he's got his pants on but he's wearing house slippers he's got like two or three vests on his clothes are all weird maybe he was cold maybe she they asked if he was drunk when they talked to her about it later and she said no he wasn't drunk but he was kind of acting like he was drunk and he's wearing some weird striped shirt all these vests and a hat and the weird thing about the hat is it wasn't his hat it was her hat it was like some big thing with like trailing black ribbons and big black feathers like a morning hat or something that a lady would wear maybe he actually was more of a crossdresser possibly but you know in this case only the hat and multiple vests I guess I don't know but so he goes stumbling out of the house acting drunk but not drunk according to his housekeeper and that was the last anyone saw him alive the next day he was found by a couple of kids face down in the river dead maybe he I don't know yeah he was examined by the coroner and the coroner said murder he was murdered why was there stab wounds nope nobody knows what led them to say murder I could not find out the coroner definitely said it was murder but no motive was ever said no manner of death was ever said he was a drunk [ __ ] there's motive right there right he was a drunk [ __ ] also the blow to the head that he had gotten you know when somebody knocked his butt out in jail and then continued to beat him up apparently maybe he had like a brain bleed or something exactly and then that's what killed him the next day maybe a broke maybe you know some type of concussion you know that's more likely but the coroner said murder and it was never solved so turnbill Canyon was named for a drunk who was later possibly murdered now its bloody history did not start there you know this land obviously was not did not begin with the white settlers that came there there were Native people there the TVA people lived there and in the 1500s the Spanish colonizers came in and pushed the TVA out and built a bunch of mission here in Southern California and uh in the 1700s they started the San Gabrielino missions and they started calling the people gabrielinos and they tried to baptize them and tried to get them to you know abandon their ways forcing their religion on the native folk exactly long history of that [ __ ] so when the native people rebelled and you know kind of fought back against the fires at the mission these these missions had guards they had soldiers and the soldiers rounded the people up and pushed them into the valley and started opening fire on them um one of the mission's founders of Father Junipero Sarah said that it was particularly brutal Massacre and he said quote when the Indian men sought to defend the women the soldiers killed several with musket balls you know it's also reported that they beheaded and tortured some of the men they took them back to the missions to torture them there cut their heads off and put them on Pikes and put it in the valley to deter the natives from acting up wow right shitty sh where do people come up with this [ __ ] colonizer [ __ ] what whatever the whole idea of we need to take is crap but different podcast different podcast so the the natives named the place uh I'm gonna see if I can say it right Hut huta they name the place huta huta it translate to the place of darkness and death oh geee that's real nice it's said that their spirits still haunt the valley and you can still hear DRS and sorrowful cries out there to this day have you been there not yet it's a four mile hike I'm going there actually very very soon probably next week I'll take pictures and let you know well because I want to know if you actually hear the drumming I might go there before this podcast airs and I'll see if I can get pictures we can put up so the the place has like a really shitty Aura even to this day the crap didn't stop there obviously in the 1840s um the area was fought over during the Mexican-American War and a man named something William okay William Workman was the original owner of the land and he got it during the um the American Mexican war this is kind of in the path of a lot of ground that was used for war between the Spanish and the natives and then the white man Americans this is like a almost like a patch of land that was repeatedly battled on not necessarily battled on um but they the Spanish did put down the natives several times there and then in the 1840s that's when the Mexican American War happened and this man William Workman was given that land as part of his um reward for you know the winning the war against the Mexicans and this gentleman named Poop Pico he was like the the main General in that war and he awarded that land what is now turnbo Canyon to William Workman William Workman was also a banker and probably very shady and his bank went under and he committed suicide after that happened that's when Robert Turnbull was able to buy that Canyon super cheap I Goa and so turn kept it so it has kind of a bloody history from the you know the the TVA there being uh brutalized by the Spanish colonizers and then during the Mexican-American War it was I don't know if there necessarily battle sites there but it was battled over then it was given to this William Workman guy who later committed suicide it was bought up on the cheap by Robert turnball a drunk who then sells it to the Quakers and is shortly thereafter murdered or died because he was a drunk and then then a lot oh yes then it gets even worse because if this is like the Bermuda Triangle like the witch hole of the universe there's got to be more there more in 1952 flight 416 was flying to Anglewood and it was supposed to arrive at 3:30 a.m. it never showed up the captain of that flight contacted the flight Tower at 3:33 a.m. close to the witching hour and said that the plane was over the city of La Habra but that's the last time anybody ever heard from them the flight Tower kept trying to radio the plane but no one ever responded after that call later that morning around 10:00 a.m. a rancher in Whittier spotted some smoke coming from Turnbull Canyon and found the wreckage so it it seems like the pilot had miscalculated during the fog and was 10 feet too low and one of their wings stuck struck part of the canyon wall oh [ __ ] all 29 people on board that plane died on impact and it said that you can still hear ex what sounds like an explosion and people sometimes will call in saying they heard an explosion in the cam in the canyon and nothing's ever found um but there's they'll see smoke they'll hear people screaming and they'll hear the the impact of the plane and that's one of the many hauntings that people the paranormal events that people talk about from there and and you know we've talked about how um you know incidents like that can kind of create a replay in time and it's almost like that accident could replay over and over and over again and that's where those like ghosts quote unquote are of coming from because realize they're dead yeah and the the TVA people were just living there when you know the Spanish came in and started trying to impose out this stuff on them and then just to be brutally slaughtered in that place the the Toma said that you can feel that their dark Spirits are still there that the place itself is dark and so that seems to be like the initial event that kicked it off and then everyone that owned it afterwards came to some sort of Bitter End and now you know a plane crash there that like you said is kind of Trapped and then there it's also been the site of several murders in 2008 Gloria Gaxiola was having a night out with some friends Abraham Akuna Matthew Garcia and Victor mongi and the next morning her body was found at the intersection of Henda Boulevard and kma Road and she had been shot in the head oh [ __ ] yeah they quickly discovered that the three guys had taken her up to turnball Canyon and shot her in the head when they pushed her out of the car they didn't realize that her foot had caught in one of the seat belts so they slammed the door shut after pushing her out but her foot was still Tangled and the seat belt was now caught in the door and they dragged her body about 5 and a half miles without noticing and that's when it was left at the intersection of those roads oh Jesus those [ __ ] were her friends and they killed her up there because they were afraid she was going to R him out for [ __ ] robbery wow right that's shitty you know people are shitty a year later I'm going to light this joint because people are shitty a year later uh Tuesday August 4th 2009 Christina Martinez was found in turnball Canyon with stab and slash wounds she had a 4inch slice across her throat several other cuts and bruises yikes it turns out she had been left to bleed out and die in Turnbull Valley left to bleed out and die in Turnbull Valley by Vincent Mendoza Edward morz and Jose aala who are all men she had considered friends she managed to climb out of the canyon and get help oh wow right and then March 3rd 2011 parts of a woman were found according to the Whittier Daily News quote 10 feet deep in an embankment with her left arm missing and her body was heavily decomposed so basically people use this as a place to go kind of kill women apparently people off yeah and I would imagine unfortunately I I would imagine that there's probably some more horrific things going on besides them being murdered oh we'll get to that we're not done yet she remained unidentified till a little while later and it was determined that she was Claudia touin a 41-year-old woman who had been killed by a gunshot wound to the Head her murder was not solved until 7 years later 2018 when they figured out that it was her boyfriend at the time took her up there and killed her and then buried her in an embankment Jesus so not just the murderers like everyone that goes there feels like the place is it's beautiful it's a beautiful spot looks like an awesome hiking trail I can't wait to go but everyone says if you're least little bit sensitive you can feel the oppression and the Darkness that's in this area and one of the more interesting Legends I found is extremely persistent it's all over the place there's this huge legend that Satanic rituals happen there and that um child trafficking happens there and that it's all happens on the site of what was either once an asylum or an orphanage I can't find any record of an asylum or an orphanage ever having been built there but the Legends are detailed and they're extremely sure and they're everywhere let me ask you a question how many places in Southern California were people doing Satanic rituals Jesus well how many places all over the country are the the the freaking gates to hell how many gates to hell do we have here I'm serious Buffy the Vampire would like to have a word there's only one hellmouth in the country the hell mouth is in Sunnydale and that's it that's where it is so all these rumors are extremely detailed about this Asylum or orphanage that was there to the point where the Legends are everywhere but yet you can't find any record of the actual building I cannot find any record there is Barb Wire Fence and no trespassing signs and people say that there are they can the ruins are there but I can't find any pictures I can't find anything other than my cousin said or my friend said supposedly The Story Goes that in the 1930s a mental institution was open there that took in your usual types you know your town drunks people that were Indigent you know too poor the homeless people who had mental problems they took in anybody who didn't have anyone who could save them from that type of place basically and performed all sorts of horrific things on them oh geez supposedly they did all sorts of you know lotes and trial experiments you know the ice baths electroshock all the terrible terrible things that people can do in an asylum supposedly they did it was also either an orphanage or they sold babies of poor people there like people that would come in that were too poor or had been you know taken because they were drug addicts or drunk or some type of um woman of the night or something and if they gave birth supposedly they took those babies and sold them or trafficked them shitty very shitty so supposedly it operated about 10 years before it burned down in a mysterious fire and there's supposed to be ruins there but again no pictures no records I can't find any records but the story is so prevalent and people will insist that it's true and there's urban legends that say that teenagers have found the place and that anyone who ever finds the place like dies in some horrible way oh wow there's stories people will tell of course it's someone who knows someone who knew someone who went to the canyon at night and saw a Satanic ritual or a child sacrifice being performed there but it's always a secondhand story or you know I can't find any any proof but the stories are thick on the ground I mean they're everywhere everyone's got a story about this place and they're all bad and PE people claim that there's a tree there where you can see if you go at the right time of day you can either see children who were hung there or a man who committed suicide hanging there and his ghost uh keeps coming back in the ghosts of these children that's that's That's Heavy I don't like ghosty children because that's sad no anything that involves kids is sad and and this place just seems to be sad you know the men who get involved with it all die in horrible ways you know women seem to die there women and children a lot of it obviously is urban legend but but there are some really shitty things that happen there in history and it just apparently that's a place that's holding on to that negative energy and you can you can feel it as you walk around this beautiful land you can you can feel the atrocities that were done to the people that that lived there well when so much [ __ ] happens in the same place Century after Century it gets like compounded and is like layers of layers and layers and layers of sadness and death and anger and creepy creepiness on that fun note I'm going to go back to smoking some more of this lovely homegrown since it's a little bit more of a body high for me get calm me down now that I'm all anxious after reading terrible things that people do to each other what what what's gonna make you anxious is when you actually go to this place please when you go make sure you come back I definitely will I definitely will and I'll bring back some pictures and we'll put them up and also don't and don't fly there don't die in a canyon don't die in a canyon we we we wouldn't want that to happen with people you thought were your friends but you know damn well they're not good people that that's an interesting thing like do people not see the red flags do they ignore the red flags there's got to be red flags we do ignore red flags but our brains are wired to accept the demon that we know in fear of the demon that we don't you know we we get so tied up up in the people that we think that we love I guess I don't know I don't want to get that deep in this podcast you know you know what I'm G to switch things up a second for all you listeners out there who are thinking wow they're getting super serious and depressing today you know what we kind of are I don't even know why maybe it's because it's raining here I just want sunshine I have sunshine and it's super depressing the world is a depressing place right now the world is a depressing place Afghanistan Palestine Ukraine there are Wars going on all over the place people doing shitty things to other people and it's just [ __ ] you're right but we need to we need to to be that light in the darkness so I just want to real quick just get you off of your depressing [ __ ] we all know it's true all the listeners got my back on this one you're you're gonna smoke someone I want to divert you I want to talk for a second about weird habits oh okay I like weird habits tell me so my boyfriend and I were talking about weird habits the other day and I said of course me being me you know how I am I was like I don't have any weird habits do you know you yeah right and he just looks at me and he's like he kind of said the same thing do you know who you're talking about have you met you and I'm like well what weird habits do I have is it a weird Habit to only brush your teeth in the shower to the point where if I need to brush my teeth I will even if I don't need to shower take a shower because I need to brush my teeth is thatd you know I was going to say it was not weird because I also brushed my teeth in the shower but then you took it to a weird place where you have to get in the shower to brush your teeth you know I brushed my teeth at the sink I don't have to take a shower to brush it gets all foamy down my face like I get drooly like a freaking like I'm like you brushing your teeth I mean I I look like I got rabies if I yeah like and then it's all like no I have to do it in the shower no I I'm also a shower te toothbrushers it's efficient I like efficient my other weird habit is um can't sleep without a fan I'm not the only one I'm preaching to the people all the fan sleepers out there when I'm camping is the only other time I'm comfortable sleeping without a fan if I'm camping I can sleep but if I am like in some rando's house sleeping in no fan it's a struggle now for the camping is it because there's ambient noise around you like the night sound of the forest maybe or is it because just you know you love camping so much that too I think it's a combo of both things I love that that peaceful resolve you know oh I know it's time wait we do win needs to be over well I've been camping quite a bit this year nobody likes anybody from California oh yes you do so I've been camping and I'm loving it what I'm actually really looking forward to in a big way is festivals I miss festivals oh my God I miss festivals oh I cannot wait music festivals Pagan festivals oh please please please I cannot wait to go do festivals you know what I miss I really miss being really really really high at a festival to the point where you might as well not even SM anymore because you can't get anym high and then some guy walking up to you and being like would you like to buy a grilled cheese sandwich for a dollar and I'm like I will take five grilled cheese sandwiches on shake down street what a memory oh the best and it's not like a grilled cheese sandwich from home there is nothing that replaces a festival grilled cheese sandwich nothing nothing I can't even you know you get a a hippie dude in his white guy dreads and selling grilled cheese sandwiches grilled cheese sandwiches out of his cooler to every High [ __ ] who's got the munchies ah yes the memories I do miss that too I I do miss festivals I cannot wait to go to Pagan festivals this year at my favorite place in the whole world Brushwood folklore Center is having Brushwood I miss Brushwood they are opening for festivals this year so we're thinking about trying to catch one or to and I cannot wait you know I know it's across the country but we're doing it how great would that be you know uh one of the [ __ ] things about Co is things like festivals went away and that suck it does suck it sucks so bad we're starting the movement bring back the festivals bring back festivals I'm just glad that CO's receding enough you know as long as things keep going in the way they're knock on wood hopefully going right now you know we should safely be able to have festivals and I'm very much looking for for to that you know Brushwood how funny would that be you know so so Brushwood folklore Center is a clothing optional establishment so what like what would they do during covid you can walk around naked but you got to wear a face mask how does that work like how does that even work imagine all these people clothing optional you know some people are just walking around like with with what God gave them all their bits hanging out yep all their all their nitty Bitties nice and comfortable and but yeah have face mask on I would laugh like how do you not laugh at someone who's completely Stark ass naked wearing a face mask you don't you give that person a fist bump or an elbow bump and be like [ __ ] yeah for keeping people safe or a butt cheek bump you can give a just bum bums bum bum bump we're gonna bum bump because it's safer why do people let us leave the house I don't know I'm not really sure why I do have one final strange habit that that I want to tell you that um kind of circles back to to ghosty stuff my My Strange habit I cannot sleep without my feet being covered like from the ankles down like like I could have my whole leg uncovered but from the ankles down my feet have to be covered or I wake up instantly I could sleep Stark ass naked 90 degrees nothing on me no sheet no nothing and I have to have my feet covered when I was 10 my grandfather had passed away which was very traumatic for me because he was my most favorite person on the planet shortly after he died I think I was still 10 I might have just turned 11 at this point every night when I would try to go to bed I would see my grandfather at the foot of my bed it was one of those as a young child who just lost their grandfather was I don't want to say it made me happy but it was a comfort it's a comfort it was a comfort but was always at the end of my bed so it was half comfort and half I thought the ghosties were going to get my feet so here now you know three decades later what did Ghost have with the end of the bed I don't know like can we take a ghost pole if there is any Spirit out there in the ghosty land that can hear our podcast why why the feet [ __ ] I was spending the night at my grandmother's house I think I was very very little and this house is one that has quite a few stories associated with it but this is the first one I can think of I was very very little and apparently according to my grandmother I woke up the next morning and came down and told her that I wanted to say thank you to the lady that had tucked me in and I described this woman who had come up and had told me good night and I and then I went to sleep and but I didn't know who she was and I told my grandmother and my grandmother was a little freaked out because I had described her mother oh but this woman had stood at the end of the bed you know she tued me in and then stood at the end of the bed and I fell asleep why do they stay at the end of the bed what's up with that I don't know but to this day I still because of that you know obviously like it was my grandfather it was not like I was like totally spooked but something about that like I can't sleep with my feet uncovered I it's like even now in my mid-40s I'm afraid the ghosties are going to get me if my feet are un covered like I don't know what it is I think that's a common thing with with blankets we all know every little kid knows the blankets are going to keep you safe you know I don't care if you know the monsters can bite my ass for all I can stay stay away from stay away from my Piggies man stay away from my Piggies you can kiss my ass just not my feet yeah I guess you do have a couple of quirks yeah yeah so apparently I did and and I was kind of shocked and I thought you know hey could be worse I could have have way worse strange weird habits but those are Shell's weird habits so if you ever if if you ever if you're ever feeling bad about your weird habits just know we all have weird habits we all have weird habits I'm trying to think of any I have and of course I don't have any of course you don't have any Weirs don't have any you'd have to ask my husband but I'm sure he tell you I have lots of weird habits I'm too stoned to think of any off the top of my head I had to ask don't don't feel bad I had I had to reach out to to my sweet love to find out what my my habits were well sometimes things are so much a part of our everyday life or or everyday our culture that we don't realize that it's different than what people do in other places you mean everybody doesn't brush your teeth in the shower what's wrong with you people right not everybody likes Hawaiian pizza you're all walking around foaming like Wolverine that's rabid maybe we just all brush more politely we do things and we don't even realize that it's different than what other people might do and take for example driving through Pennsylvania and you'll notice in Pennsylvania a lot of the Barns and the houses have what seemed to be common to Pennsylvania pretty pictures and symbols all over them and they sort of kind of resemble each other they are actually called hex signs they are a a a Pennsylvania Dutch thing and they're they're they're very they follow kind of that superstition kind of visual spell if you will theme one I can think of in particular that that is fairly common it is two doves kind of hovering over a heart oh I've seen that usually like on a house or something yeah that is supposed to you know bring luck and good fortune to to your marriage and family oh I love that that's so nice there is one that uh has these uh two kind of doves on either side of a shamrock not a shamrock a four-leaf clover not a four-leaf clover a three-leaf Clover whatever you know what I'm talking about shrock yeah and that is supposed to bring luck to the property and to the crop and to to the owner so wait it sounds to me like you know obviously a heart is love and a and a clover is luck so are the doves like the I know in some like we talk about the dove of peace or whatever but are the doves just like the bearer of that energy like what does the dove symbolize in that I think it is because they're very they're very prevalent in a lot of the hexine designs um you will see these doves in don't quote me on this but probably like kind of half of them I'm not saying half I'm not saying a lot of them the the dove is pretty common it's a common theme and I think it's more of a representation of a vessel you know the dove brings you the luck the dove brings you the happiness um I see I like that they have ones that that that kind of symbolize you know a good harvest a good crop a good a good season with your animals things of that nature so so it's almost like symbolized magic but if you were to go to a Pennsylvania Dutch person and tell them they're practicing witchcraft oh Jesus Lord well that's kind of like Peter Carroll one of the people who writes about chaos magic it says that uh quote belief is a tool for achieving effects so basically that's what these symbols are people have belief in these symbols and then they that belief brings about the effects that they're looking for basically so you're saying they they have this belief in these symbols they don't think it's witchcraft they don't think it's magic but what they're actually practicing is hedge Magic Kitchen witchery or chaos magic right right but they just are afraid unknowledge embarrassed scared to realize [ __ ] it's all magic to them it's just everyday life you build a bar and you put a protection symbol on it that's just what you do it's so common to them they don't realize that it's something else as well but these these hex signs um they they are a Pennsylvania Dutch specific thing and some of that Pennsylvania Dutch Heritage folklore background kind of stems from the the Germanic Dutch tradition you know these these are things that kind of translated when these folks came to America but it is definitely something that is specific to that Pennsylvania Dutch culture and I wouldn't say it's it's necessarily stayed in Pennsylvania I have part of my family hailes from Central PA and you know my great grandma and my grandma and my mother always displayed these these hex signs within our house I grew up with hex signs my kitchen yet I grew up in Upstate New York so you know I didn't I I I didn't grow up in Pennsylvania necessarily but because I I had family roots in PA those Traditions kind of stemmed out out of central Pennsylvania so you know people do all around all around the country still kind of brought that with them brought that with them based on potentially having um Family Ties Family Heritage that roots in Pennsylvania in that Pennsylvania Dutch grouping now did your family talk about them did they say what they were or did were they just there did they explain anything about them did they ever call them magic or tradition no no actually you know funny funny story you know might they they found a lot of symbolism in it they felt that you know let's say the luck one truly brought you luck The Happy Home One truly brought you a happy home but this is also the same side of the family that was ready to to hang me from The Gallows when they found out about me being into to paganism and Witchcraft when they had kind of been practicing that magic all along without realizing it because to them it was common it was just something that they did but when called something new they were afraid of it they condemned me the most when I quote unquote came out as a witch they they they definitely condemned me the most and definitely taught me the most magic growing up how [ __ ] up is that yeah that's wild that's wild because again they they didn't they didn't know what it was they had this this traditional way of thinking about it and weren't really willing to go outside of that and and I don't know I don't know if you remember back then but my grandmother was kind of brutal when I came out and my grandmother my grandmother was the one that had a hex sign in every damn corner of the place right she was the Wiest of them all exactly but it wasn't called witchcraft it wasn't called Magic you were just Pennsylvania Dutch and that's what the Pennsyvania Dutch did you know and it was it was that's just a Pennsylvania Dutch thing no it's magic [ __ ] right but they but they just they couldn't wrap their head around the fact that that was actually some Hoodoo voodoo [ __ ] you know right it's hard for sometimes people to see especially when it's similar especially when it's familiar it's hard to look at it through a different lens when it's good for you to do that and people definitely should take a step back and look at things through someone else's lens because it it gives you so much more understanding but it it's hard it's hard especially for older people to do that but you know really if you were to take a drive in in the warmer months you know the summer months just suck every or the the winter months just suck everywhere people but in the warmer months when you really want to be road tripping nobody cares about California nobody cares but Pennsylvania is a great place to just kind of take a drive and you you'll just see driving down the road you'll see Barns and houses and buildings and you know they can range anywhere from you know a 10inch wide uh hexine to something that's three feet wide I mean some of these guys go freaking all out and are decorating their these things absolutely they're absolutely gorgeous I I love that it's it's pretty m it's it's magic that you can put up in your home and look at it and and have it be part of your deor okay I'm not into the P Pennsylvania Dutch Farmhouse Decor but it's very very beautiful and people put it on quilts they put it on hand towels they they put it on all sorts of things and it's giving you that protection because those symbols have so much history and so much you know energy behind them that there's still they still have power they still have magic and I love that it's pretty magic and you know it it definitely has that German feel to it some of the symbols in the symbolism kind of have that German feel because you know again kind of that Pennsylvania Dutch entity for lack of a better word at the moment because I'm high I can't think of the right word that that all stems from from the Germanic folklore um and Germanic culture so as much as we call it Pennsylvania Dutch it really does root more uh going back further into that German culture and you know this type of deep folklore is everywhere and going back to the modern news we're seeing that in in Ukraine we're seeing that in these women and these people that have these folklore Traditions that are kind of like witchcraft the woman with the sunflower seeds that is a powerful [ __ ] curse right there I would not be pleased if I was that guy I'd get the [ __ ] out because that's that's a badass curse yeah I know that there are uh there's a whole city there was a whole city did you hear about the The katop Witches there was some uh tanks that went into the city called katop and they were basically laughed at and told they need to get out and they said Every Other Woman here is a witch you're going to wake up and not be able to get your dick hard and and the guys there were serious and I guess this goes back to like the 1600s this place is Infamous for having witches who don't take any [ __ ] and and this type of folklore not get hard make your dick not work and that's a powerful curse and these women these these people who have these these ties to this folklore they're not going to take any [ __ ] and they will throw a curse at you if you deserve it they'll [ __ ] your ass up man you know I'm a big believer in you know harm none not yourself try not to harm anybody but I am also a believer in Cara and sometimes don't [ __ ] with me don't bomb my country don't kill people that's that's shitty and and I'm willing to take the consequences of a curse in that case and it sounds like so are they you know and that kind of I always used to say about my kids you know you [ __ ] with my kids game on man I'll go to prison with a smile if you [ __ ] with my kids the same concept exactly if you're willing to accept the consequences yeah same concept same concept and in this case you know these people that woman with the sunflower seeds The katop Witches they're willing to take the consequences because it's worth it in this case it sucks that they're pushed there but yeah I mean it would be nice if they didn't have to have it come to that but you know but sometimes the world is not fair the world is not going to give a [ __ ] that you're G to turn the other cheek sometimes the world is going to bomb your hospital you know raise your house to the ground and kill your kids kill your wife and kids right in front of people and yeah you yeah with no [ __ ] given right right so sometimes sometimes you have to combat that with whatever you have yeah but you know I I I think that these folks have a deep you know in the Ukraine these these kind of a similar thing you know there's a lot of symbolism there there's a lot of a lot of a lot of their folklore is something that they've turned into their own based on deeper folklore from where they've come from um I I guess the easiest way to explain that is the Ukraine folk kind of similar to the Pennsylvania Dutch you know the Pennsylvania Dutch um the hex sign and all of that that kind of originates and is a Twist on their German roots and their German folklore and with the Ukraine folks you know they have given their own twist and created their own folklore and traditions that kind of go back from from their r which is actually pans Slavic in that whole Slavic mythology right right so so they've kind of similar to Pennsylvania they've taken their their folklore from their deep roots and kind of turned it into their own and and you know it it does kind of again kind of root in that Slavic paganism but it's it's it's the the what the Ukraine have turned their own twist of that you know what I'm saying does that make sense makes total sense like how the Pennsylvania Dutch kind of they've given their own twist on on the Germanic Roots right yeah so they kind of they've made it Ukrainian yeah yeah but they they you know they're big into dancing this is I I I was looking into this and I was looking into some Ukrainian folklore ever since all this [ __ ] started happening and [ __ ] started going down you know I'm not going to talk about the the details of the current state of events but I just to say different podcast but that president first of all he's strikingly attractive all of a sudden and I think part of it is his attitude it's not all looks people it's not all looks it's his attitude in in the way he's carrying himself that is super [ __ ] attractive he's doing an excellent job embodying the big ball Spirit of the Ukrainian people the the absolute tenacity that they're having in the face of of this horror he's he's doing an excellent job of being an amazing Patriot and strength and someone that they can look to we would all hope to have a leader like that but it has created an interest in knowing more about the Ukrainian people in the Ukrainian culture yes and if for nothing else those folks deserve people knowing who they are you know and I have found out some interesting things oh do tell do tell I love interesting things I'm interested in Ukraine tell me this very attractive president has my interest in the voice of Paddington Bear right he's piqued my interest in knowing more about the Ukrainian people and with the way I am I always go the I want to know about your magic and practices that way these folks dance like [ __ ] did you know that no I didn't they have like these elaborate extensive ritual like these dance rituals but to them they just call like dancing around a bonfire like like we do at festivals nice I'd call it dancing around a bonfire okay okay not that fun then okay all I can think of and this is horrible and I probably shouldn't even say this but you know in um National Lampoon's European Vacation yes they go to Germany and they're dancing yes like like that more like that and like dancing around a fire at Brushwood okay okay these these these [ __ ] dance and they whereas we might do a ritual where we might do a chant let's say they're gonna do a dance so that that that plays a big part in their in their ritualistic ways which I found intriguing not that I can dance I can't dance but their earliest dances were actually Circle dances not necessarily around a fire but Circle dances that that were directed at poking and prodding their agricultural wishes you know so like a lot of early uh Pagan magical things it was based around agriculture it was based around feeding people and taking care of people or Waring against people based around Harvest yeah they they would dance for harvests but then you know they would dance for weddings and they would dance on holidays that that were coming up but here's the weird thing ritual dances in Ukraine were rarely performed to music it was actually they were dancing usually to a chant what so normally you think of you think of of of people dancing in in whether it be getting your groove on while you're cleaning or in a ritualistic setting you you think music no these people would chant and dance to their chanting that's kind of cool which I found very interesting yeah so that was really for the rich ual but they're folk dancing more of the dancing to have fun and not necessarily in a ritual context they would do they would do with or without music but for ritual it was without music it was with just chanting which I thought was interesting but when they were dancing for say a wedding or to celebrate a joyous thing then they would dance to music on occasion but if it had to do with ritual no music so I thought that was neat I could see that being very powerful yeah yeah they do have some famous dances the Aran and the hopek I probably saying that wrong and I apologize but they also had this these enriched beautiful uh traditional folk dresses I don't want to say a costume per se but they would have special dancing dresses and even today they have several UK Ukrainian dance groups that actually perform they even have a UK a Ukrainian dance group that performs in Canada and what they try to do is they try to keep that traditional folk dancing alive you know Western Traditions you know the technology of the new world today not a lot of people are dancing is a is a ritualistic thing or even is a a folky kind of Pastime thing so there are groups that are trying to still keep it alive but I just thought it was really neat you know there are a lot of of of Western European communities that that heavily put dancing in in their in their traditions and in their ritual practice and I did not know it but the Ukraine folk are are some of those those folks oh very cool you know I wonder if that uh if that Ukrainian dance group um I believe they're out of keev that's in Canada I hope they're still in Canada I hope so I hope they're safe me too wow very cool that's really neat so dancing is part of ritual I like that but I just you know I found out some I just I just found out some neat stuff like I didn't know that and you know I'm not the most agile person especially as I get older but I do I do get I like to watch folks that that do these ritual dances and and these symbolic dances I do enjoy watching it I just am not always the most agile person to be doing it but there's power in movement just like there's power in sound just like there's power in voice there's also power in movement these people have have have figured out a way that their idea of trying to do rituals tied to farming and hering and hunting um and births and weddings and burials if if they're able to to create those rituals around dance and and that movement of energy I think that's super [ __ ] cool and I just that's something that that was very new and interesting that I had found out this week about the Ukrainian people folklore of all sorts of places is pretty interesting and especially now that's kind of that's pretty powerful definitely I don't even know how to say it I mean it's all just so shitty I don't even know you know other than donating to some of these Refugee places I I don't even know what to do it it sucks I hate I hate not knowing I hate not really I hate feeling powerless to do anything you know I I I think this I know that there are a lot of places that are taking donations and there's a lot of a lot of folks out there trying to to assist people in the Ukraine I think one of the the best options I've heard how to get money on the ground to these people is quickly as possible Airbnb try to find a Airbnb rental somewhere in the Ukraine book it for the soonest date available and then and then pay for your booking obviously you're not going and staying there but you are getting that booking money in that host's hands right then and there um a lot of these Airbnb folks are uh utilizing their space to help House people that house their housing has been bombed out and what have you that is a a good option to get money on the ground as quickly as possible where you know every cent you're sending is going to a Ukrainian household rent an Airbnb for the soonest a date available um and and you'll find that the costs of some of these airbnbs are are very very cheap so anything that that you are able to do would would help these people greatly you know milakunis has a fundraiser she's also working with Airbnb and they're working with GoFundMe and there's several other you know that's another place that you can donate to you know if you want to help refugees so many different places just make sure it's a vetted organization and again we'll have links to these in a couple others that we know are good places to donate in case you want to uh to help out in in the few ways that we can you know sometimes that's all we can do you know we can't we can't do everything um we can only do so much but you know what's money money is paper right if we've got a couple of bucks we can send it to these people who just like these people got nothing like what the [ __ ] how would you wake up and and have that be your [ __ ] show for the day I couldn't even fathom it no you know do little things we might not be able to change the world but we can certainly help out in our little corner of it you know be kind to the people around you be good to your neighbors something everybody can do something you know buy groceries for the person who can't get out of their house you know go run errands for the you know the guy who can't get out of his house down the street or something you know help the little old lady next door and shovel her driveway just be nice to each other send us Snack Factory pretzel crisps oh that would definitely be a
