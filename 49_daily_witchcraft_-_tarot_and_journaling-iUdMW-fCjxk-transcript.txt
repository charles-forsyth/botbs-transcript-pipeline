all right five four action welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity where Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hi and welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I'm shell we're going to be talking about daily ways for you to get back on the broomstick in particular using tarot cards and journaling and you know it feels like everything with us seems to always Circle back to tarot ain't that just the thing it's kind of where it started it is it is but you know I do like the idea of pulling a card each day you know get back on the broomstick is hard because obviously something kicked you off the broomstick so getting back on is hard so even if you only did it like once a week even once every two weeks there's something to be said for it because it kind of gets you back into that mentality of being magical and present at least for 5 10 minutes you know before we jump into getting that deep about it though shell I kind of want to talk about some witchy stuff that happened this week in particular I want to talk about the fact that we just had our one-year podcast anniversary so yeah I really wish I had champagne to pop if you have like some way to put in a champagne pop into our sound do it okay future Leila insert champagne pop noise here and a cheer y yay yeah it's pretty cool that we made it a whole year and things are going even better than I thought but in particular I wanted to talk about the present that I have been teasing you about for weeks finally arrived so not only are we going to talk about my present that arrived but we're also going to have a little lesson in karma here folks if that's what you want to call it I suppose it is I'm there so what we're talking about is I had commissioned the lovely hags hesper and Monica over at three Moon brooms to create some custom witch brooms for shell and I to commemorate our oneye anniversary of back on the broomstick and you know first of all thank you so much I love you second of all holy these are the coolest things I've ever seen in my whole entire life oh my God these chicks over at three Moon brooms like they knock it out of the park with these brooms wherever you're getting your brooms presently you need to stop in your tracks and go check out three Moon brooms because I was blown away they're amazing the craftsmanship the Artistry I just love them and I love the witches I mean let's just face it they're amazing ladies and okay the karma part I suppose is I have been teasing shell about this present forever weeks weeks people weeks ever since I commissioned The Hags to create these brooms I have been holding it over Shell's head that she was getting a surprise and she hates that she even had my sweet love boyfriend in on this and he's teasing me when she's not they've put me through hell hell it's been awesome I absolutely love every second of it wh why don't we talk about your karma let let's talk about this why don't you tell people fine fine so the lovely hags sent me tracking numbers because you know magical items from one state to another you want to keep track of that mondan or not I want Amazon giving me track of numbers who you kidding that's right so shells was the one that I was mainly focused on I was so excited about it I watched it every second until it arrived at her door sadly mine is still stuck somewhere in Illinois three days later yeah so but you know what people this is why ilila has to suffer okay and you know it could be UPS it could be the postal system I don't know but she knew my package came at 10:30 in the morning she knew that was a work at home day for me and yet she commissioned my man to make me wait until like 6:00 at night to open the damn thing because she wanted a video so here I sit all day looking at this package knowing I can't open it and I'm like what the holy hell and she's giggling spending the whole day giggling so I got mine three days ago you still don't have yours that's what you get my friend yeah I guess so now in my defense I had thought it was going to get there at 9:00 p.m. at night when I asked your sweet love to take the video yeah I know 10:30 in the morning I suffered all day I know cherry on top I loved every second yeah I am suffering for it now though but I I do want to put this out there for anybody who's worried about you know how am I gonna order a full-size broom and have them ship it to me and have it everything be okay let me tell you folks these ladies know their  when it comes to packaging and packing this thing it was Fort Knox it took me 10 minutes to unwrap this thing so if you have any fear of it getting ruined in transit I assure you it could not happen even with a nuclear bomb and while we wait for my sweet broom whom I've named hagatha by the way while we wait for hagatha to get here hopefully shell will take lots of beautiful pictures and post them up on our Instagram so you can see this gorgeous broom that is kind of a sister to mine how could I not I got to torture you now H all right that's fair that's fair okay so now that we've talked about our actual broomsticks let's talk about some of the things that we have been doing this past year to help us get back on the broomstick again circling back to tarot that's right right back to where we started tarot and journaling now I got to admit it took me a minute with journaling you've been trying to get me to journal one way or another since I've known you and I've always kind of pushed back and I was always surprised because you were always the keeper of knowledge you kept that handwritten or typed out Book of Shadows for the entire coven for yourself you know for everyone so I was always really shocked that you didn't take it one step further and do journaling but I'm very grateful that you did all the book of Shadow work that you did you know I think it was more of a we were kind of in a religiously spiritually repressed area and putting it mildly putting it mildly it it was some of it in the beginning was you don't want to write some of your thoughts and and and ideas and stuff down because God forbid someone come acrossed it good point good point and then it just kind of turned into writing all of the Book of Shadows stuff down like how many hours in a day can I be writing here people because I had my own Book of Shadows I was I was you know scribing for I was doing the coven Book of Shadows your hand gets hurting after a while that's very true and I think that's a part of why I kept a largely Digital Book of Shadows back then because it it was a lot of writing we were learning a lot we were taking a lot of notes man there was writing everywhere yeah but that was back during dialup phase and I didn't trust the internet with my digital stuff because the internet was like a week old and one click of the clickity click and it's gone so I never trusted a digital Book of Shadows and even with the coven we had a lot of the stuff digitally but I was the one still handwriting that out or I would put it in a Word document and print it out so I had a hard copy but I just never trusted digital because one wrong click and it's gone yeah and it's definitely very nice to have the handwritten or the printed out it it's just it's a different medium and it I think it accesses a different part of the brain I know for a fact for me that when I handw write things in a journal it's much more intentional and I'm much more present and it activates different parts of my brain it feels different when I'm writing it as opposed to when I'm typing it well actually that's what I was going to just say is that with the books of Shadows stuff when I would hand write it I retained it better if that makes sense absolutely I'm not saying that you don't retain stuff that you type because obviously do but there's there's something with handwriting it that I feel at least for me I retain it better if I'm writing it yeah same and I feel very much more connected to it when I'm writing it it makes it more like a magical document it really does such a thing mine are kind of a um an amalgamation of both I have handwritten I have typed out things I have scraps of paper I have all sorts of things stuffed into my different journals and books of Shadows and I have more than one I have several for different purposes dude I could make a whole book of shadows just out of sticky notes and Note Paper alone okay seriously it is not a neat process for me now for some people journaling or writing might be a neat process but what right and what we're referring to doesn't necessarily have to be a diary but it can be very much a part of an intentional daily practice and the way that I do it is usually at night when I'm starting to wind down before I go to bed that's when I'll pull out my tarot Journal I'll pull a card for the day and I you know I write about the card what it is use my own intuition my own feelings about the card and then I I look it up usually even though I've been doing this for 30 plus years after I write my own feelings about it I will look it up in particular because I've chosen a deck that's very different than a traditional Tarot deck so again it makes me engage different parts of my brain and makes me be much more present when I'm working with it well I've kind of done this haphazardly on and off for decades oh yeah it's a great way to learn the cards or to get very much in touch with the cards as a reader well I think I took more of the perspective of you know obviously you lived through it with me you know I had the kids and I had Sports and I had band and I had theater and like I had man and sometimes I could do the pull and I could do part of the reading but then one kid needs something oh my God someone needs to get picked up it's a ride whatever you know I had to have a way to go back to it I'll look at my book of shadows and you know I'm not an artist I'm like the least thankful artist and what I would do is I would draw the little boxes to represent the cards in the shape of what whatever spread I did you know because I would use different spreads yeah so I would draw the little boxes and then write what the card was in the box so that I could go back and look at the layout and then kind of do a little Deep dive introspection on what the hell just happened oh yeah like this super esoteric shorthand KFC for like king of Cups but I mean it wasn't something I was doing every day but when I would do a a PLL like that or do a spread for myself I would document it in my book of shadows and I go back now and look at some of them from you know 15 20 25 years ago and I'm like yeah too bad I didn't listen to that whoa right I in particular always do a New Year's Eve spread or a New Year's Day spread and I will keep that usually digitally actually I have it in a Google documents I have like such a g I have like Decades of New Year's Eve spreads that I have done I like birthday spreads birthday spreads are good too I'm gonna because I feel like that's my personal New Year yeah yeah those mine and mine alone you know Milestones you know it's always good to do them at Milestones but in particular now I found a lot of um strength I guess a lot of Serenity a lot of personal journey I guess I'm kind of on a personal Journey right now you know getting back on the broomstick getting back into Witchcraft and using the cards just felt right because we have been doing this for so long I mean we were professional tarot readers at one point we have an intimate connection with the tarot and I mean it's useful in so so many things I mean Carl Yung was fascinated with the archetypal images of the tarot because it is such a good tool to get in touch with yourself to get in touch with your own personal journey and where you're at so pulling a card or two a night has been really helpful for me to not just get in touch with my witchy side but also to you know get in touch with myself and to kind of you know work through my own well I have taken as you know probably a good five or so year break from tarot sometimes you need a break man well you know as you know probably more so than I do there was a point early back in the day where we were doing a lot of readings for other people as well as workshops and giving classes and presentations on Tarot we were younger and a little less wiser and I don't think that I was taking the proper precautions to be dealing with that many people's energy and it was sucking the soul out of me and I needed a break after a while I started getting mad at having that break after about five or so years I was like what am I doing not doing tarot cards who the hell am I once you healed you know once you got through that and healed then you were looking for that kind of connection again but you know we always joke and We've joked about this on our podcast We've joked about this when we've been guests on other people's podcasts I have an addiction issue people and let's just take a minute put it mildly sh let's just take a minute you know I like to call it more of a I don't know if obsession is the right word but I feel like appreciation appreciation addiction makes it sound bad I currently own and I say currently because we all know that this will change I currently own 178 tarot decks yes you just heard that correctly 178 she has a spreadsheet people I have access to the spreadsheet so all my kids you know you gotta do what you got to do it's alphabetical at least um but I like a lot of different cards for the look but I only used a couple different ones and about a year ago around the time we we launched here I threw you for a loop 178 different decks and you know I had a favorite for a hundred billion years but I decided to go back after that long break and start with kind of that OG deck I got the Pamela Coleman Smith version of the rwe Smith deck and I've been using that classic it's a classic and but the funny thing is with as many decks as I've always had I always stayed away from the classic I almost felt like well that's not cool enough you know I always stayed away from it and this last year there's something about it that been digging I've been really digging it I think when you use different decks it can give you different perspectives on those cards 100% yes because you know I always used that Ellen Canon Reed witches tarot well the imagery of say The High Priestess on that is different than the imagery on the rightwe Smith you know what I mean so you can kind of start pulling different things by using different decks and and and utilizing that different imagery that's the beauty of it and and we will get into a deep dive on tarot cards in another episode I mean we're going to focus today more on using them as a tool to you know get back on the broomstick but the tarot is such a beautiful thing because they are archetypal they do have generic General meanings that they all pretty much follow but there's also intuitive meanings oh gosh yes an artist or you know when you get these people together like the deck that I'm using right now is phis curat The Witch's wisdom tarot the artist is Danielle Barlo who's phenomenal these cards are stunningly gorgeous so you get the artist and the the author of these cards together and you get their magical Synergy going and they're going to take these archetypal images that are the same the world round and add their own flavor and their own style to it and maybe bring out something that they see that's important to their particular deck and and that's why I love all these different ones because like you said you can really connect with some of them in different ways and that's why that whole stupid myth about you have to be gifted your first deck is the dumbest thing because you really need to connect with the deck you might buy one based on the pictures and then realize as you're going through it that it really just doesn't fit you and it's so important to find one that speaks to you and that you feel connected to I always said that one day I was going to take all of these Decks that I have and take a card or two from every deck and like create the perfect Tarot deck and the only reason I thought it wouldn't work is because all my decks I mean not all of them but like there's some that are bigger there's some that are smaller and I'm like they're not all like a uniform size so I I think that you know pulling a card every day is a good way to kind of feel that flow get back into that flow and if the energy isn't working with the deck you have go get another one they talk about the whole gifting thing you just mentioned whatever man go on Facebook Marketplace and you can actually find people who will be willing to swap decks or you can find free decks if the deck you have isn't Jing with you get a different one now I've had a story before where I did have a deck that I did not jive with at all um it was a a deck an artist had made that was mostly collages beautiful beautiful deck but unfortunately every single time I used it it predicted Doom and Gloom no matter who I read for it was all disease death your dog's going to get run over your Lover's going to leave you everyone you know is going to die and that was you know a little traumatic to see over and over again yeah so I ended up at one of those workshops I was just talking about we were doing a presentation at a New York state school a New York State College talking about tarot afterwards with a young person who was very very interested and this deck just seemed to really want to be with them so I your it did and I was like Hey apparently this was meant to be yours go forth and be happy together and you know sometimes it just goes that way my very first Tarot deck I hate I still to this day hate it I don't like it it's in my collection don't get me wrong for Nostalgia purposes but I I don't like it I never liked it and I almost gave up tarot because of it really did now did you buy it for yourself or did someone give it to you I think I bought it for myself I'm pretty sure I bought it for myself but it would have been in one of those circumstances of that was the only one I could find gotcha and also back in the day we didn't have the internet to look these up there wasn't even the Encyclopedia of tarot Decks that you could look them up in we didn't even really have a metaphysical store we had a card and gift shop that had a little back corner that was secret with witchy stuff that's right they pretended that they were a gift shop and they had the occult sh hidden in the back and they did not allow you to open the decks most places would not allow you so you basically had to look at the box and one decision right make make a decision make a decision right there and you might only have one two or three choices not the hundreds of choices that you have now now you know the Decks that I've predominantly used and how I like the pretty and the flashy my first deck was at Aquarian tarot oh that's a weird Tarot deck so today we decided to talk about the the cards we pull and I find it very interesting because I pulled one one and you pulled three first of all why did you pull three well I intended to pull one card but sometimes when you pull cards more than one comes out with it and that's kind of what happened here so I pulled one card and I got three at once so I decided to go with it you know when that happens you just kind of have to let it go now what deck did you use I'm just nosy that's okay the deck I used is the witch's wisdom tarot and I've been using that for myself personally again because most of the Decks that I've used have been um the writer weight deck type you know the very first deck I got was a an old rider weight deck and you know kind of used those I'm very familiar with that type of deck no matter who has made it their own this particular deck uses different names for the suits it has you know different ideas so it's enough different for me that it's like looking at it all new again and kind of gives me a fresh perspective so I very much like this deck as a personal reading deck it kind of challenges you instead of giving you the same old same all that you're used to with wrer weight yes exactly exactly it's and it definitely challenges my brain it makes me think about the cards in a different way plus they're stunningly gorgeous I absolutely love the art on these cards and that really helps me to because I'm a visual reader when I read tarot when I put the cards down for myself or someone else I'm really looking at all the symbols in the cards how they connect to each other how they connect to how I'm feeling the colors the symbols you know the things in it and these cards just are very rich in detail so I like them a lot and I kind of wanted to do the reverse to be honest with you I kind of did the reverse I went from the beautiful artsy you know different named suits and that back down to the basics I kind of felt that after my break I needed to kind of start over with the basics because I never used a basic deck right even in the beginning years ago I never used a basic deck so I just wanted to try something different that I've never done before and go to a basic deck yeah so we we did the exact same thing oppositely it sounds about right now I want to point out that that we pulled our cards uh for today separately and you did not know what I had I did not know what you had I did not know you were pulling three cards so I'd been like oh maybe I should too and I actually ended up guessing one of your cards you did when I pulled my cards you said what did you get the empress and at first I said no I got the goddess of Earth which in this deck is um the Queen of Pentacles and then you know I saw I had three cards one of which is the great mother boom otherwise known as the empress and then oddly enough karmically enough coincidentally enough magically enough your third card happened to be the same exact card that I pulled in my one card spread which was the number eight strength yep and we both got that card now the other thing I wanted to mention kind of circling back to the journaling thing is even if it's a one card like I just did the one card still write it down because what may make sense today and what makes sense tomorrow or a week from now could be two totally different things also sometimes depending on life moon phase whatever's going on who knows you might have a clearer vision of it after mulling over it yeah I totally agree with that and you should definitely write down all your impressions just like shell said no matter what comes through because like she said it might not make sense now but it might make sense six months from now when that particular thing comes to fruition or becomes more relevant in your life so don't you know don't discount what you get you never know when it's going to become relevant and also this goes for for both sides of the coin whether you're brand new and trying to learn tarot or if you are a seasoned tarot Pro this is a good way to kind of really get to know the cards or you know like for for a seasoned person if you've got a new deck it's a really good way to get to know your deck not only are you pulling a card for yourself and seeing what that means in your life and putting this big puzzle together but you're also really immersing yourself in the cards because it's just one card or three if you accidentally grab three it's simpler I mean in my journal I'm going to show shell very quickly it's just a small journal and I just write down like what the card is and what deck I used and then I write down my Impressions and then I go to the book and I write down the things that jump out to me the book definition and I put that in there and that really gives you a very well-rounded idea of what's what's in the card and and what's in store for you now two things that you mentioned that I just want to touch back on first of all you're you're going into this say you're going into this you're like all right I'm going to do one card pull because that's what we both went into this in and you know like Leila said three cards jump out you didn't do it wrong that doesn't mean you up that means you went into it with one card but three of them got something to say to you you know be cognizant if cards fall out of the deck when you're shuffling or or be cognizant if if you're trying to pull one card and two or three stick together and they come out that's I don't want to say that's normal but it's not you didn't mess up you didn't do anything wrong yeah sometimes they have more to say than just one card can contain right you'll get to feel the difference between oh I just kind of dropped that and oh wow that felt like it jumped out and it's important and so you'll kind of be able to discern which it is but honestly either way in the beginning like shelle said it's a great way to immerse yourself in the cards so if more than one jumps out whether it was an accident or intentional Just go with it and see where it leads you it'll definitely help you get more connected to the cards and the other thing I wanted to point out is you know definitely write down your impressions write down what the artwork means to you like Lea said but go back to that day D book every every deck comes with at least a little pamphlet book go back to that book even if you've been doing this 20 years there ain't no shame in the game going back to the book don't take it as a damn gospel by any stretch but the way I've always looked at these little books or the pamphlets or what have you is taking my intuitive thoughts taking what the book says and kind of putting them together and see what I get out of it you know what I mean absolutely don't ever be embarrassed going back to that book definition and the book definition especially if you're using someone's personal created deck is going to have slightly different variations like we said earlier it's gonna have their intuition in it exactly and so you want to learn that you want to kind of immerse yourself in all of that write down yours first write down all the things your impressions first but then definitely go back to the book but by getting into the habit of of writing it down and doing it every day or as often as you can it allows you to make that time a little more magical and one of the offshoots of this that I have done is sometimes I'll turn that into a little meditation you know I'll pull that card and I'll take five minutes to you know pay attention to my breathing to slow down to really focus and meditate on that car to just bring it up and bring that image up in my subconsciousness in my third eye and really try to connect with it and and just kind of Center myself and sit with that card for a little bit lately because it is right around imul I've been lighting candles while I do it which makes it that much nicer and and it really gets me into a very centered quiet you know meditative magical space and I I enjoy that time and it's really helped to connect me with my witchy side and it only takes like 10 minutes well you know in in line with journaling Lea and I are going to touch more on this in depth in upcoming Solarium but I recently got a Tarot journal in the mail and I was like hey that's a great idea and it doesn't have to take up all that space in my book of shadows and you know one thing I've never done or thought about and this has kind of prompted me writing down the moon phase so you know when you do pull a card write down the moon phase or if there's I don't know if there's a storm moving through if there's some type of rainstorm or if there's lightning or Mercury's retrograde you know whatever whatever is is going on because these are all outside influences that could affect you in that moment you know I might take something more serious outside of Mercury retrograde than maybe in because it's just a show you know so you got to kind of be aware of where you and the univers is at to get a full scope of what the cards are trying to say yes I love that and I actually love that you brought up the tarot Journal because we did get these journals from wiser and I was a little skeptical at first because I do have like three different journals going right now one where I do my morning meditation where I draw my sigil for the day and then at night I do my tarot card pull and I was like why do I need yet another Journal you know you were like yay I need one more and I'm like why one more no then I went through it and it's really freaking handy it does kind of the same thing that I was doing in my journal I I think what makes this one really good for me is all the imagery happens to match the deck I'm currently using the imagery Shell's talk about is one of the coolest parts of this journal and that is the pages and pages and pages of tarot card stickers you heard it stickers stickers tarot card stickers I love these it is the typical Rider weight tarot cards they're mini they're smaller than a postage stamp about half the size of a postage stamp but it's in there so that when you do your spread instead of like shell used to and me I don't have to draw my boxes anymore right no more drawing boxes with you know Q of P right you can go get the actual tarot card sticker and put it on your page which is so freaking fun I've already decided to use some of them in spell work though so hey that's a good idea some I'm totally stealing from the journal and going to use in spell jars and in other spells because they're that cool really the point is if you are kind of charting your tarot Journey it turns into a journey instead of just kind of this thing you're doing here and there it it makes it a journey because you can reflect back and you know I think that starting off our new podcast year with a pull is a great idea and you know you look at these cards and if you focused every day say you did this for 78 days there's a whole Tarot deck so whether you are New or Old to tarot it gives you time to become one with tarot or become one with tarot again okay you you keep saying Journey so I can't not talk about the Fool's Journey the whole Central big theme of the Tarot deck is the Fool's Journey it's basically the major Arcana like shell said if you actually wanted to do a deep dive into your own psyche and rather than do random card polls if you wanted to actually follow a magical journey there's books on it there's all sorts of things online but you start with the fool and you you follow the fool through a magical journey as they find teach as they learn about themselves as they learn about the world and magic and then go through the whole thing and so that can be a very deep and meaningful Journey you can do that in conjunction with Shadow work it's very very powerful but that's a a different type of um I would say that's deeper magic than just doing random card pulls that's much more intentional and more of a a longer term journey I would think but I think with the with the pulling a card every day now I agree with you you said you do this at night you're going to find where places oh you got to do this first thing in the morning I can't think first thing in the morning come on I'm not a morning person at night I can put kind of that energy and that thought and that time into it and I think that by doing that it kind of centers you a little bit more it does it's almost like a ritual without casting the circle and calling the quarters and all of that you know it's like it's like a mini ritual and you get insight as a bonus you know you know you actually made me think of something shell that I hadn't really realized until now in the morning you know I I have my caffeine I I have my wake and bake I have my little Sun ritual I Journal a little bit and I do sigil drawing then I'll draw a Sigil for the day and I I started this back at Brushwood when I was doing the festival circuit I really liked drawing a Sigil to represent something that I wanted out of the day and that works for me in the morning because when I do sigil work I tend to be very not spacey but you know how you kind of feel in the morning where you're you're awake you're aware not quite awake but yeah you're kind of Zony you have like the early morning stairs I call it groggy but yeah gry yeah yeah you know you're kind of zoned out you're there but you're not really there that's the kind of magical mind State I like to be in when I draw a Sigil when I create sigil work and so that works perfectly in the morning whereas the cards are much more intentional it's more brain work I think I need to think about it more I need to pay attention more and so as I'm winding down for the day it really does help me to put away the day pay attention to my cards and kind of reenter and get back to myself and I hadn't really thought about it until you said that that my brain wouldn't work for tarot in the morning but it does work for it at night so you have to find what works for you I guess is the point I mean this goes back to just because some yahoo says it online doesn't mean that's the gospel you know if you want to do your tarot pull at 3 in the afternoon rock on with your bad self whatever works for you but I think that if if if tarot is something you're into and you could do this with other things it doesn't have to be tarot you could do like you and I've talked a billion times uh you and your husband do room pulls daily or you could do bone throwing daily or you know you could use your pendulum whatever the case may be but I think some sort of divinatory exploration within yourself isn't a bad way to kind of get into a Groove magic I highly recommend trying to do it at the same time or roughly the same time every day it really helps to not only keep it a habit but it also helps to get you into that magical mindset you know if you're doing this at roughly 1 p.m. every day or whatever it's going to be easier for you to not only remember to do it but to get into that magical space and into that meditative space I totally disagree with like here folks um you do it whenever works you know and and and I think part of that is just because I've always had that that busy mom life right where I can't necessarily always commit to the same exact time every day and even at late at night you know my kids you don't know what's happening you know so I can't say at 10 o'clock every night I'm going to do this because it might not work out that way but it's in my mind okay it's it's evening or it's nighttime I need to fit this in so I do disagree with the exact time but maybe the same try to stick with the same time of day whether it's morning afternoon nighttime whatever yeah whatever works for you the main important thing is to try to find something whether it's making your coffee in the morning with intention drawing sigils for the beginning of the day you know or meditating on your crystals in the middle of the afternoon whatever it is that works for you find that 5 10 minutes that really helps you to

three card spread and a fourth card popped out so check out my post on Instagram and our posts on Facebook to see what cards I pulled but tarot works for every occasion and I think that's why I always go back to it it can be medit it can be informative it can just be educational I mean you can you can take tarot from so many different angles you know and and I think that incorporating something so Universal into your daily magical life can kind of help you maybe expand out to other things that you weren't thinking of or aware of tarot's a beautiful thing I could talk for a 100 hours on tarot same it really really is and you don't have to use it as a divinatory tool oh absolutely not it does not have to be something that you are you know psychic or get messages from the other side you can simply use it as a a meditative tool a way to get in touch with yourself these images are archetypal or Universal they're meant to speak to most people and now there are thousands of decks out there and please buy them from a reputable Source do not buy Teemu tarot decks please please please please please if your Tarot deck comes with a QR code and not a book it is counterfeit and the artists and authors do not get credit or any money for that so please do not Teo your decks but anyway I an I'm an expert at buying tarot decks so if anybody has any questions you just shoot me a message there
