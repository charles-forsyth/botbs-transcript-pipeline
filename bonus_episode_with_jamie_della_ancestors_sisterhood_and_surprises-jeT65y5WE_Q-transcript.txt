couple weeks back and her name was Amanda and she wrote this is the first episode I've listened to and I'm completely enthralled I had to park at the office so I could finish listening I can't wait to hear the next one and I am definitely getting my hands on Jam's new book oh that's really cool hey Amanda welcome to the broomstick this is how we build community one one hug at a time one hug at a time oh or one connection right that just I'm having so much fun watching what Connie is pulling together I mean it's it's been really exciting so much has happened since you were on last I'm I'm loving all of it it's great and I love how Connie is mentoring still more than just you she is mentoring so many people right I mean so I'm here in Orange County um where I grew up and my family has lived here since the late 1700s and I've been coming to grips with their Heritage their legacy the the good and the Ugly of it and it's a lot it's it's very intense to be a witch and to feel this strength coming from this Legacy of Spanish and Mexican me people and then recognizing that's also the colonist line as well and and feeling also very connected at the same time to the spiritual side and and creating this healing so this last weekend I came to Pagan pride and I'm holding up the um the program 25 years so I've been going to this since 20 years ago I sat with Raven Raven gasi and we signed books together nice and and I haven't been you know in a very long time because that long ago there was a lot of infighting Among The Coven in Long Beach and and it was just not comfortable for me because it wasn't where I was coming from I was I was approaching ma magic as a form and a practice of my healing not for anything else and so when this last one I was at um so and where I did my training was at I of the cat in Long Beach California and that's where my mentor Connie did her training that's where she became became a teacher and then she had left it and then that's when I was one of her early at home students but she had also had a coven she was forming and and so this is the first time I'm back it's the 25th Annual Pagan pride of Los Angeles in Orange county in California and I was just cruising around visiting my friends here I was asked to be on another podcast I was asked to do a divination conference and it was like this homecoming feeling it was just amazing and then I was in the eye of the cat and I recognize people but I didn't always have this all they get to recognize me thing oh yeah you know if you start talking to people or you can't remember their name exactly but you're like your birthday is in May you know like some funky aspect you know and so I'm sitting there in the eye of the cat booth and then suddenly one of the girls from another Booth ran in and grabbed the woman that whom I recognized but didn't know her name and she said Kelly Kelly did you hear the book about Connie is out and Jamie Dela is here to sign it she has a workshop she's giving I don't I don't know where she is and I was right right there there I was like a foot next to her and then I I said it's me you know and it was so funny because my friend said well you it would have been really fun if you could have just said cooly like oh tell me about the book and and I said of course but I'm not cool yeah I I would have done the jumping up and down thing myself Ila would have been the cool one Lea would like yeah yeah tell me what you really think tell me what you really yeah give me give the inside scoop before you know who I am or remember who I am but they they remembered me so they they turned and went oh Jamie and so we're going to have an an event at eye of the cat and Connie's daughter is gonna fly down from Idaho and her son and ladies it feels like uh like time warping on itself you know it's circles within circles and home and amazing synchronicities all over yeah and healing much healing know a lot of healing a lot of healing so yeah now speaking of circling back you're in your bedroom I know H how how does how does that feel I have done a lot of healing with it like if I could carry the whole podcast thing I would take you around the corner which is this was my um this was the master bedroom and it was built in the so there are two closets and they're both mirrored closets oo and then there's a mirror over the vanity and a there are six mirrors talking about returning to a circle that at 55 I can come to my teenage bedroom where I I mean there's still a dent in the wall where one time you you love this so I'm at the end of the long hallway and the phone would ring and back in the day before everyone had a voicemail before everyone had you know the ability to capture anyone calling at any time sometimes the phone could just ring and you might miss a very important phone call3 something run down that run down that hole and it was a carpet as soon as I got to my bedroom and I and I turned to make the corner and I slid into the wall and so there's still the dent where my knee hit the wall and I crawled I crawled ladies I crawled to the phone hello you still answered the phone life or death situation you answer the phone that was me I admit it right right we're right there so yeah being in this room and then also seeing all these mirrors and realizing that's why I was so self-conscious Jesus every time I got out the shower I looked I looked at myself six times it was it was constant and all that energy coming in all the spirits of being here for 200 years and having those spirits being able to come through all these windows at that age when you were there in all those mirrors were you cognizant of magic and spirituality did you know the extent of the mirrors yes because my because my Nana was a psychic reader and she told us that was those were their portals she said they will come through you know from the time I was four years old she was educating me on magical portals like 11-11 mirrors toilets Windows Doors how you seal them how you bless them how you bless a house um but she didn't wasn't the you know wasn't smudge sticks and that kind of it was more like Bells you know and and sometimes there was that concoction U my friends and I would do with like baking soda and a pie tin and you would light it on fire and and and like and and different like different ways of of just exploding smoke and air or whatever you needed to to move out the energy and so yeah I remember her she was the one that would because my room was so cold you know like the temperature would drop when I was a teenager and I actually wrote about it in the book where my nana s me it was on the shadow chapter where the Nana my nana SS to me well honey the reason you're such a is because you got all those Spirits live in that room with you even for my Anana she was like well you're kind of a right now you're 16 you're privileged you know what I mean this whole thing but for some reason the spirits want to talk to you so they're living in this room with you and it's probably hard to sleep now go back to your bedroom with all the poor go back to your bedroom with all the portals and bless each one and not fear it I don't know if you ever read um CS Lewis the you know Chronicles of Narnia so there was one where you go into the um the woods between the worlds kind of like where you are shell like where you remember that ilila where you would go into the woods between the worlds and like each tree was like another opportunity to visit another place right and you drop into another time all the portals I've learned to look at them as portals do you want to go down that one or not do you seal it or not do you give it energy or not you know you carry your family and you work with your family ancestrally you had said last time that you were on you had written a book about teenage magic spells for teenage and then you redid that book later and Revisited your teenage self and and parts of the book had come from your own journal yeah and then you Revisited that and kind of the book grew up in that time frame so how is that now kind of you yourself have changed a lot and working with the spirits of your ancestors has probably changed a lot so how is that going back there now are those same portals open are the the same Spirits there how has it been reconnecting with that I um I'm no longer afraid I feel like as much as I knew that I could say to the spirits you know this is my time my life my Human Experience I felt obligated I felt like I'm the one listening I need to do do this healing work like when that phone rang when you were a teenager you felt compelled to run to answer yeah yes it that's oh that's good she's good she's good she good but yeah so I felt compelled to answer like I'm the one listening I need to answer and I felt that was true with wiah you know when people would say why are you standing up for wiah in 2000 when it's scary It's like because I can and then I sat down and handed the photon over to somebody else and now I'm coming back up again yes the whole that that Holy scepter there like this is what it looks like when you get your own Sage this is a song to sing you know and and really be that person that's willing to walk the talk talk The Walk all of it so I guess how I feel right now is yes the the difference between the teen spell book and the book of spells was 18 years it grew up and that was just a rewrite really in 2019 now this book was fully formed from the beginning to end and yesterday I was on a walk with my son over these natural Bluffs and he said Mom I just started reading the book and I've cried three times and I'm barely through the introduction oh wow a and I like almost dropped to my knees right I'm like oh and so for me that's Full Circle Healing because it wasn't necessarily easy for them to be raised by a witchy Mom right right as I mean as much as we went to Waldorf and they were all excited and I got to be the you know the Midwife of the medieval games and all that good stuff it's still you know she's still different my mom's withing I I can totally relate to that um I was the weird mom and my kids were good enough that they weren't embarrassed by me but they knew that other parents would be saying stuff other kids they'd say oh her mom's a witch but I made made sure that my kids knew these people are just mean and when you say mean things that doesn't make you a better person and my kids never let it bother them never I don't know that my kids did either because literally when one of my sons was getting over his a heartbreak he did a ritual to get over it you know I mean they were they were adept at it I think it just made them feel they were a little bit different but I think also because we were at Waldorf and my books were at for sale in the in the company of Angels in their Bookshop like I was celebrated in the community as as a witch so I I don't think they felt the danger that I felt right because I was a public witch because of going to you know mainstream events like I didn't have them feel that it was just this WOW cool different in the middle of Orange County here's a witch you know Joe Frost gav and yavon Frost's daughter she spoke about this very thing when she was growing up it was very difficult for her because of how famous her parents were and how active they were in the Pagan community and she wanted nothing to do with it for a while because of how difficult it was and how dangerous it was sometimes for her and she has kept her children very much shielded they are very Pagan you know we see them at witch events and things like that um but she she does try to stay out of the Limelight as much as possible because it is difficult for people once you do get to a certain notoriety I guess in the that you know sometimes the interactions aren't always positive you know you were celebrated uh in that one Community but like you said before you went to bookstores and book signings where people were like oh you know how to cook a witch or whatever and and so it you know it's a double-edged sword I think and it can be a balancing act even now yeah and and that's why I'm excited to go to a Barnes & Noble on Saturday and you know and and it was a really kind of fun and crazy thing I was I brought in this this amazing kit of some collections of my my cousin who has a candle who makes candles another cousin who has herbs a friend who has like an aerosol or a hydrosol spray all these people donated this and you know like today I went to this coffee shop that I have been going for 20 years she put the because I've been going for 20 years I go I've been writing a lot of my books here maybe you didn't know but here's witch talk and she puts it up right in the front there's no other posters but she puts that's poster up and then she put she goes we'll put the other one here and and it's just this wow this is family that's support this is family and support and I feel like that's my spiritual work right now is receiving the support is not looking for someone to throw tomatoes at me to not you know to not look at what has been but to to think oh these are there are so many people here who are going to Moon lodges and and different um different events for the solstices of the equinoxes maybe not all of our you know holidays but the you know the big ones that they know about and they're leaning into this and they're going to sound baths and so why wouldn't they come to this event why wouldn't they learn a little something why not go get that sandwich board and write something big and make it beautiful and stand out and say yes I am a witch and it's it's so celebrated now it's Wonder celebrated and and you know know the time right you do it on a Friday the 13th in October it's a good time people will show up it's great energy people show up yeah and they feel more open because they really feel like not only is the veil between the worlds thinner in terms of life and death or fairy and human but also you know where people can think a little more expansively you know at this time you know maybe bend a little bit of their rigidity and see the the what Witchcraft and this witchy life can offer them and I think a lot of that happened during the pandemic yeah because that shift people were bored you had nowhere to go nothing to do other than kind of expand your mind yeah I agree I I I agree especially when my book went into Target and I saw those numbers I'm like huh toilet paper and a book of spells awesome but I agree I feel like it was a a really big in breath for the Earth you know a a setting point and and I wish that I felt like we had that same setting point in terms of seeing ourselves as part of that of that web versus the divisiveness that has unfolded you know just just have more of that reflection of how beautiful nature really is and how important it is to like look up at the Sun and let you know not straighten the Sun but let that are circadium rhythms come back you know yes not always walking out in sunglasses sometimes just even with your eyes closed just to feel the sun on yourself learning to T to walk with our bare feet or raiki on our feet or whatever it is as we go about our day now that you're spending a little bit of time quote unquote at home what are your plans for the eclipse the solar eclipse this weekend I have um two book signing events so the one in G and& Noble at um 1:00 and then um there will be a witch walk at this place called the Anaheim packing district and it's the old Citrus packing house um built in 1919 where my grandparents met and and 10 years ago I was the community relations manager of this place I launched it and now I'm coming back 10 years later with my books at the front of the steps where it all again Circle started circles yeah look at you with all the circles and circles this is just lovely energy here I'm loving it it's well we we were talking about this ancestral healing and I think it's a real balance especially at the with Eclipse times coming with this just buildup of energy right and feeling like there's so much you want to do for your family and ancestral healing and then on the other hand I have friends be like well you know I could do a raiki treatment and you would just be cleared of all that and you would never have to go through the process you wouldn't have to carry their burdens and I find I see your faces and this is so much fun there is something to be said for the process there's something to be said for the process and so so I like I said I live in a place that was the first um they were the first uh really honestly settlers there's no way to put it around it they were the colonists they were the they were the Army and the colonists who came here to establish Southern California so that part is the ugly right right and and then what happened is within a you know a couple Generations they received their karma and then some with their loss of land and home and um status and so there is this one I go to the family this history museum for Anaheim so this is all right by Disneyland all right like literally I hear Disneyland fireworks go off at 9:45 every night and it's war zone it's very loud but so there's this river that bends around us and we're in this hill in the elbow of that River well I went to the history museum not so long ago and there was a story about a grandmother of mine who was command who commanded four horses to be five four horses to be bound together and walked across the river backwards and forwards during a flood but the part where the where the river bends and widens out there was this one narrow spot where you could walk back and forth to trample down the sediment and the and the quicksand and then lead people out of the area after they've been at your house for a one week Fandango or whatever it was you know and and so this is exactly where I collect my sage this is where the Sage Brush grows exactly where this part is where they walked across there's a monument about how this the American Army camped at this spot and this is where they crossed the river and that's how it got its name on Santa Ana because it was on her feast day she's the grandmother of of Jesus and she's also the patron s of horseback Riders interesting a mountain that's called Saddleback Mountain because it looks like a Saddleback and I mean it's just it's very alive here for me and if people say like well how do you tap into like the Earth and I'm thinking I don't know maybe it's 10 Generations maybe that's how do you not how do you not at that point how do you not especially being the witch especially the roots and and the proclivity to looking at the magic to seeing those connections and not denying it to feeling your room changing temperature and going those are all those grandparents they just keep talking to me because I got my porch light on and right you know and they they are like you're listening you're going to help us and maybe sometimes I think part of that is just how OC turned out to be such a snotty judgmental place maybe it was part of that Karma maybe it was part of what they did amongst each other maybe it was part of the way that they treated the First Peoples here I don't know you know it's it's at part of Indiana Jones when you make the step and you don't know where the step's coming but you know that's what you're supposed to cross yeah and you have to just keep putting your foot there and trust that that step next step is going to be there even if your are deceiving you a little bit you know in your heart it's there yeah and that and that's what it feels like here and so as long as it feels good to tell their stories and there's definitely been times when I was I felt approached by a Native American um leader here in LA and I said I'm not the one to tell your story I can't trace my roots to you and this would be offensive and this was in TW this was in 2005 or around that time when I was like I want to tell your story because you are the you are the California Native American Jonah Arc her name is toy Pina and she started a revolt against the Spanish missionaries that was pretty badass for her and she was pregnant and she was 24 and wow there's so much that I wanted to tell her story I want to know this story yeah hear it oh my oh my God I went to the San Gabriel Mission and I could hear the cries of the native people I could hear the whips and the and and falling into like Vats of soap and I got so mad I went to their church and I wrote a petition and I burned it from their candles and I took the ashes and threw them on the sacy I was yeah you were a mad witch I was a mad wit now you had said that you didn't feel that that was your story to tell do you think your time at home will prompt you at some point to maybe tell your ancestral story say via a new book say yes that is um at this point the working title is River beneath the river and that is about this River and that Subterranean river that lives in all of us so as a metaphor and I would hope to work on my craft of writing to be able to include the river as a narrator or a character because and I would start in um 1846 and I would end at modern time and I don't know how many it will go through seven of my ancestresses seven of my matriarchal line and um I'm and and I'm excited to see what happens because I really feel like what's at stake here is the the mother daughter wound the sister wound you know especially as I see it manifest here in Sou in California where there's just so much competition and there's just not the same Sisterhood I mean maybe in the tight circles but you just don't see it like out in public where where sis where women greet women and so I feel like like it's not to me it's not ancient history because I so live in it right here it's I feel it and I'll have I'll have uh flashbacks and memories of like the when the River flooded or like it's not safe here right now like why do I feel that way you know this kind of thing has nothing to do with the you know what's happening today there's something historic that I'm feeling that connection you're feeling to to the people that walked that land before and and the Earth land itself yeah and the Earth and and the poppies and the sage and the chapparel and and just knowing like I'm you I've been gone I live in the mountains now I don't live here so I came back and I'm like look at the noal oh we would have a good Feast like that you know and I just like this instant memory of how you would how you would cook it you know and and you can see yourself cooking it in huge Vats and on outdoor stoves and and just balancing that because sometimes it gets so invasive in your face and I'm on a book signing tour I can't write this story right now right just like the ancestors of the spirits won't let you go sometimes sometimes you have to tell them or tell that hold on a second no I want to I want to Circle back to a box of magic like you said you are you're doing your book tour now you've had it out for a little while I have been following your amazing book signing tours on Instagram you look like you are having a blast by the way I am have you learned any lessons new since the release of the book absolutely my biggest lesson that I'm learning learning ladies is to receive support that can be very hard for strong women that can be hard that that's my hard one and and compliments you know like my friend today we were taking a walk and she you know we've been friends for 20 years so she's watched me come out with the wickah cookbook and hustle the teen spell book and the enchanted diary and the wi herbal and the you know like going on and on and on and then she's like you've worked so hard and I want to be like God you make me sound like a loser right now like I'm thinking to myself part of me is like yeah you worked so hard and you still aren't there yet but you feel like you're closer maybe you're closer maybe you're not and I said you know what the difference is this we've been friends for 20 years cut if I was doing this whatever even 10 years ago and I would have a book signing event I would expect you to be there you're my friend you're there now I'm just grateful if you're there I no longer expect it and so therefore the support comes easier floods in more and then it's then it Cycles back again where I'm needing to learn how to receive it and at the same time be like okay and what's happening with you keeping your friend file intact you know and at the same time where you're making posters and getting them over and pasting it on here or putting it over there like just learning to be so grateful for whatever comes you know it's hard because when the book first came out its Amazon rankings were really high and I was so excited and now they've kind of dwindled and I'm like you know what don't worry about it you're making connections you're going out there you're meeting your readers you're reconnecting with people like you guys you ladies I don't like to say guys you ladies on you know on um podcast and having connections that matter with witches who have history like Amanda who wrote who your episode for the first time you know people are definitely being touched by you and by your work yeah and not worrying about numbers but just the depth of connection like that's I think that's quality over quantity yeah and at the same time you have that little feeling that I think and I'm going to paraphrase this horribly but it was like I think it was doy Lama who said by the time you reach Enlightenment you won't care and it was something to that effect so I feel kind of that same thing about success now I have another question question have you talked to Connie since the release of the book absolutely she's actually I'm like where is she I I she brought I brought her to the Pagan Pride so I got to share her picture with the people who studied underneath her and a picture they would never have seen before and I feel like she commandeered that funny little happening in eye of the cat nice the little connection the little connection and then I called her daughter Alexa and we had a long conversation about how present Connie is and how and then I think the really the coolest part was when a dear friend of mine sent me a card and said I don't know if anyone's told you but I bet Connie would be very proud of you right now and that was so powerful oh I know the other thing I did the other thing the real big the first one that I had a conversation with her I remember was when I got ready to pack up so I'm packing up everything for five book signing you know events I've got did you forget your clothes I forgot my clothes yeah I forgot my clothes at the top of the stairs I forgot my clothes and I went lay in bed at night and in this bedroom right here the first night and Connie said can you do your magic in a deserted on a deserted island she asked me can you do your magic on a deserted island cuz that's what she used to always ask me air is in you as your breath fire is in you as your spirit water is in you as your blood Earth is in you as your body you don't need a black witchy outfit to emanate your witchiness you don't need to look like XY I mean I am a little bummed about the green cloak a good cloak is a good thing to have a good cloak is you know it would have been great but and it wasn't just like the clothes it was really about confidence because that was Connie's what she gave me all the time because you know everyone's got something to work through and confidence is mine I hear you yeah and no matter what I do right like no matter how many accomplishments and just feeling loyal to myself at every every second every choice I make is I make for me for my confidence like leaning in to take a sip of water versus waiting until the end of the podcast like why would I do that you know just you know those little moments when you choose yourself so when Connie said that and then I went to Pagan Pride I got purple velvet pants that I would not have bought if I had left my suitcase at home I I got the most beautiful black flowy dress that will be perfect for witch walk I so you were meant to leave the suitcase at the top of the stairs I was meant to to know that it's in me already I don't there's no part I'm playing it's it's coming out that magic that it's oozing out I like at it kind of like an armor that you don't need yeah oh darn it right are we are we recording this yes I told you she's good but it's so true because you were kind of using your clothing is a shield exactly and the card that I had pulled was like okay what do I need to know about this for my Ganesha deck and it came up generosity so it came up keep giving like you said take the take the shield down and open up to the reciprocity that's going to happen on this tour because you know when I first came out 23 years ago it was like the wickah cookbook you know it was you're the Jamie D Jamie wood you know and it's part of you is like you want to believe that you're coming out of your Saturn's return and that feels good you know and and realizing you allowed yourself to open up and and probably have a better exper experience because you were unshielded and you got purple pants and I got purple velvet pants yeah and this really beautiful Shaw that is all embroidered and it's just apparently I look really good in lilac I had no idea and so it was just you know when you put it on and people walking by in a festival stop and tell you you look good it was that kind of a moment and so yeah it was it was it was such a blessing to know that I can walk around without having to protect myself like you said without having to Shield myself that connections will come I don't need to force them I don't need to even oh like I make a few and let that roll because sometimes as a double Capricorn I'll just keep producing until I'm exhausted I mean I was going to drive down to San Diego and and all sudden I was like wait a minute I have three events in this town that I haven't made posters and put up in coffee shops I need to stay here you know and and learning I think pace learning Pace that holds my that keeps me energetically strong yes and not outpacing yourself oh see look you two should put a podcast together we should shall we should you're just so good do this I think you should do I I mean I love this I love the fact that in this conversation we all get to we're all taking turns with nuggets right yeah right well I think we have a great Synergy we have a great energy together we always love talking to you get the magic energy going so it's definitely fun oh thank you now we're not the only ones apparently that love and adore you like I like I said with our initial Instagram uh comment so I hear you got a little something something that you're willing to offer here to our listeners oh yes we would love to give you an autograph copy of a box of magic from me to you I always feel that connection when I know who it is and and I will write something that's personal you know versus just your name and just to a person I just it's my way of intuiting something and sometimes I I'll write you are too cool to be forgotten like we did when we were in high school but right but in any case I want to have a giveaway of a box of magic so that
