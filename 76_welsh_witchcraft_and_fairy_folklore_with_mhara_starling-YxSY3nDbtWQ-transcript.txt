join us as we get back on the broomstick welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Lea and today shell and I are honored to be joined by the delightful Mara Starling Mara is a Welsh folk witch a Tarot

Otherworld welcome Mara Starling and before I start let me see if I can say hello in Welsh Koso no very close so it's coroo and then the second one pround pround okay so Al you want if you want a little cheat though um up in the north of Wales up in the gogs where I'm from uh we don't say pin hounder because we always think that sounds a bit too Posh so we shorten it to p p p okay so we're getting the the local dialect going on there I tried I tried I love that you speak Welsh and I think that's very very cool I only speak one language so I'm always fascinated by anyone who's multilingual all right so we recently saw you at lelling con and you said that we were stuck with you and we took you up on it now we've got you here we're delighted to have you so thank you for being here with us Mara oh thank you so much for asking me yes so you didn't take my offer of buying some anti Mara fungal cream then rush we passed we passed no we passed on that we were like bring it on we'd like to have more Mara in our lives so we're very glad to have you here oh marvelous now I also noticed while we were looking through your books we were very lucky to be able to read an advanced copy of your book Welsh fairies which is wonderful but one of the things I found out that had nothing to do with whales or fairies is that you and shell are both Geminis oh yeah that's true yes I a Gemini both of us all four of us yeah no Aquarian over here I'm staying out of that mess but so now for shell she is very much a Gemini a lot of her personality is being a Gemini is that do you find that's true for you too Mara oh definitely so I fought it for many years because I wasn't a huge astrology person for a long time and I tried to fight against it you know the stereotypes of being a Gemini but unfortunately I am or fortunately depending on how you look at it I am very much uh a very stereotypical Gemini I'm always torn between who I want to be what I want to do um I feel like I have numerous personalities hidden within me and it's always a battle trying to figure out which one takes to the surface that day um I constantly have various interests going on in the background and I'm drawn in 70 million different directions yes that's my life that's my life gosh well that sounds very familiar it's fun isn't it actually I didn't know that I didn't I didn't make the Gemini connection so thanks Lea no problem you're outnumbered now I always have been shell there's two of you so you grew up in the northern part of Wales on an Little Island the aisle of Angel SE in your town I believe it was native Welsh speaking yes so I grew up in a little place called aera and Abid fra sits on the oh gosh let me figure out my directions um it's kind of in the never eat Shredded Wheat Southwest Southwest of the island um facing the Irish sea so we were looking over towards the mainland of Wales on one side so the mountains of Ari and then on the other side on a very very clear day if you were very lucky you might see all the way over to Ireland and in that area in in that specific location um the population was predominantly Welsh speaking so a lot of people talk about the Welsh language in terms of it being a minority language and it is true we are a minority language but in my experience in my upbringing it was a majority language because pretty much nobody around me spoke English growing up all of my friends we always communicated to each other in Welsh my family at home we only spoke to each other at Welsh um in school it was all carried out through the Welsh language the only time we spoke English at school was during English lessons so I think I looked into it and I think by now at this point because it is unfortunately a very well fortunately for me growing up but unfortunately for the reason I'm about to say Abra The Village itself is a rather beautiful place rather gorgeous filled with beaches and Coastal paths and all sorts of wonderful history attached to it um and so it's become a very popular area for a lot of uh and I might be getting a bit too political in saying this now but a lot of very rich English people people like to buy up the houses and um they don't live in them they don't live in the houses they just have them as Holiday Homes and so a lot of the locals are getting pushed out at the minute so I think it's dropped a lot since I was a child and I was growing up there um I think when I was growing up there it was around 70% of the people who lived in the village were first language Welsh speakers and spoke it as their native tongue and now it's down to around 60 so it's gone down around 10% over the last few years due to those issues but it's still a very predominantly welsh-speaking area you'll hear it as you walk along the streets and um it wasn't until I moved away to University I went to university in England to Manchester Metropolitan uh that's when I started speaking English regularly before that it was all just through the medium of Welsh oh wow I understand that the Welsh witchcraft Edition is very much a a Bic tradition it's a lot of folklore and poetry and songs and that type of thing has has your relationship with the Welsh language did that help shape your witchcraft or your entry into magic oh definitely so when it comes to my relationship with my cultural identity and my language I genuinely believe that becoming a witch helped embolden my sense of pride in being Welsh because and I've said this on a few other podcasts in the past so I'm sorry if anybody's listening and they're hearing me repeat myself again but I grew up with this almost sense of Shame for who I was and what I was uh mostly because you know on one hand you've got the fact that I was a very uh loud and proud queer person living in a very rural area that was you know can sometimes be difficult like it was filed there was a lot of judgment there was a lot of um you know I was very much one of the very few queer people in my area and so I didn't feel like I fit fully and I spent a lot of my very early teens feeling like I didn't belong so much that I couldn't wait to leave I couldn't wait to pack up and move to some urbanized area where I felt like I'd be more accepted and it's only through finding witchcraft finding magic finding paganism um that I kind of re-embraced that side and aspect of my of my identity uh it was through finding people like Christopher Hughes who is the chief of the Angley Druid order and he not only is like you know the chief of a druid order that was rooted in the local traditions of Wales but he was also a very queer person and he was very authentically himself and celebrated for being himself he's now not only is he a chief of the Angley Druid order but he's a drag queen on Welsh television he's a television presenter a mortician he's fabulous he is and I think his fabulous nature helped me to see I'm not alone here I'm alone in being who I am and I can live as a very much fully Welsh person and a very much fully queer person and they don't contradict each other so that was really like enlightening and shifting in my mentality for when I was growing up but then also because so when you grow up speaking Welsh as your first language you kind of take it for granted you not you don't see it as something special because it's just you just speak it every day it's your everyday life yeah exactly and at school or at home we would sometimes be um reprimanded for speaking English so for example in school if the teachers heard you speaking English in the corridors they would sometimes give you a bit of a telling off similarly if I went home and I started speaking to my father in English he'd get angry and he'd like get grumpy with me and he would turn around and in in well she would turn around and say I don't speak that um colonizer language that speaking to me now speak to me in your native tongue and stuff so there is this sense of when you become a rebellious teenager one of the things you do as a Welsh speaker is you kind of renounce the language a little bit and you're like well that's the language of my teachers my parents I'm different I'm rebellious you know I am edgy I don't want to speak that language and it was through coming into paganism and discovering the magic of my landscape and the magic of not just the culture but the language itself the amount of magic that is woven into the language the culture and the expression of our culture that I re-embraced that side of me and I was like no I don't have any shame towards my language or my identity I love it and it was actually a huge privilege that I got to grow up speaking this language so I should embrace it fully so yeah I think my Welsh culture and my identity and specifically the language were huge in influencing the way that I started treading my my way down this path are you training to be a druid as well or have you completed that training so I have kind I suppose completed it because I did a training course with the Ang the Earth with onour and um yeah I'm now an aen of the Angley Druid order and it's it's odd because I've always had a little bit of a clashing when it comes to druidry because when you look at druidry within its modern expression especially you know the revivalist Druid orders that are very popular in the UK in America in Ireland and such a lot of them are very influenced by uh the over culture of England so like a lot of the movements in the early 20th century to establish what we call Pagan druidry there was obviously revivalist druidry long before Pagan druidry came into the picture but when Pagan drry Reed its head it had this very English middle class kind of expression and for the longest time I struggled to Grapple that as somebody who grew up you know on a council estate which is essentially poverty in um a very small Welsh rural area I couldn't quite relate to this kind of middle class English expression of druidry that I kept seeing everywhere and so for the longest time I kind of fought against being labeled a druid because I was like oh no I'm not a druid I'm a witch you know I'm a I'm a Nails in the dirt bottles filled with piss kind kind of witch you know I don't do that kind of um dressing in white and going off to celebrate on the Tower of London Druid I'm I'm a I'm a witch and it was through Christopher really that I kind of got over that feeling because Christopher reminded me that a lot of what became druidry in its modern sense within the Pagan spheres was influenced and inspired tremendously by Welsh culture we have this thing in Wales called the aeod the national stod and the national stod is a celebration of culture and art and specifically poetry and it's one of the biggest most important festivals within the Welsh cultural context and the folks who run the aod who make sure that it moves the way it should move and such are called um God be and God beay are essentially an order of Druids they're an order of Druids but they're they're cultural Druids not religious Druids and those Druids were established in the way that we see them now by a guy called YOLO Morano who was also the influence for what we now refer to as modern Pagan druidry so a lot of modern Pagan druidry draws upon those same sources that theod in Wales draws upon and it was through realizing that connection and being like oh crap this is like my Heritage and the legacy of my people here um through realizing that and also coming to the realization that when it comes to you know what what's the difference between a witch and a druid in a modern context and coming to the realization there there isn't that much of a difference really we're very similar um I finally kind of accepted it joined the Angley Druid order and now yeah I'm a druid and it's still weird it's still weird to call myself a druid because I still see myself first and foremost as a witch um but yes I am now an ath of the Angley Druid order tradition of druidry very cool nice I have something that I have to show you and this is going to be the funniest thing you've ever seen and I I I have a friend uh from England who sometimes calls me a dumb American this is my dumb American moment for you so you recently did a video um on the Mabinogi and which was fabulous by the way but I have to show you a little thing I made as a coven project all right dear listeners what you can't see is that sh is getting picture of a project she made for her Celtic traditionalist coven when they were studying the Mabinogi oh my goodness it's my mouse on The Gallows I made little Gallows with forks and I put a mouse that is my mouse with the Gallows I used a tissue box to hold up the forks I was proud of it I was proud of it and that pictures of my mouse on The Gallows have made it all across Salem Massachusetts I love it I think it's fabulous oh my go that great it's gorgeous I love it yeah that was my craft project for the Mabinogi I love it and I love that part of the story as well how can you not read that part of the story and not get little forks and put a mouse Gallows on it most people don't sh all right now that I've embarrassed myself completely Lea I got you sh back to the interview so oh Mara you talked a lot about being first and foremost a witch and I I'm with you there I feel that deep in my bones that connection to the Earth and to feeling the Magic in that way I guess being connected more to the cycles and to the Earth it reminds me a lot of the animist view of magic and of paganism and and I see that a lot in Welsh mythology and in the stories there's a lot of that the trees are alive the Brooks are alive the wells are alive I mean everything has a spirit to it and the Place seems to be crawling with magic everywhere you know how do you connect to spirits of land and spirits of place oh well you're absolutely correct throughout um all of Welsh law really there is this impression that the world is inherently alive and you know that kind of hints towards this animistic world view which I think is really interesting considering you know a big um kind of critique that a lot of modern pagans like myself get from the more academic scholarly side of this stuff because you know we're not the only ones who look to the MAOI and to mythology and such and to the Poetry of of old whales we're not the only ones who look to these things there's a whole academic you know sphere that loves to explore these things and one criticism that I often get and people like me often get is that there's no evidence you know to point towards the idea that a lot of these things are ancient that they extend back into some pre-christian past that the evidence we do have is very minimal if it's there at all and that we're silly and we're stupid for assuming that these characters are gods or that there's anything Pagan going on in these stories and one thing that kind of trips people up who have that opinion who have this View and mentality that there is no inherent paganism or inherent pre-christian thought behind these stories is I will always turn to them and I'll ask well how do you explain then the concept of Anan and so Anan and are these two concepts within um the Mabinogi which comes up specifically mostly in the fourth Branch the very fourth ending kind of branch of the four branches itself um and in that one there's this idea that magicians can not only change the external appearance of people but they can also change the very Soul the very nature of something and when they talk about the very Soul the very core spirit that something has that's not limited to humans and that in and of itself the idea that humans are not the only things with Souls is inherently not Christian you know there's something in that that isn't very Christian in its cosmology because you know the Christian cosmology dictates that we are kind of above everything else that we are special because we have a soul because we are the children of God created in God's image and we have a soul whereas the animals and the plants are made for us to do what we will with by God shaped by God and this idea within Welsh mythology that animals have a soul that trees have a soul that kind of contradicts that so it's the people who turn around and kind of say oh well you know these stories they're only Christian they're Christian medieval stories I always turn around and I say that to them and I go what about this that's not very Christian how do you explain that and none of them can ever seem to answer that question but a lot of my view of the world my world view is shaped by that sort of mentality you know I don't believe that I am above or greater than anything else that exists on this planet with me I'm part of a cycle of a you know of a constantly moving shifting cycle of life that just happens to be that I am a human and not something else but that doesn't mean that I'm better than anything else and so when I talk about my relationship with connecting to the land I always say that the main thing that I keep in mind throughout all of it is that I interact with the world around me in the exact same way that I might interact with other people so my relationship with the trees my relationship with the spirits of the land my relationship with the sacred Wells it's not too dissimilar to my relationship with my friends my neighbors my the people around me you know you do little things every day to keep that sense of community to understand that connection you have to them so my entire philosophy is essentially to treat the world as if it is inhabited by people but to also remember that those people are not always human and I hope that makes some kind of sense I love that yeah no that I I love that philosophy that makes perfect sense now the other thing with whales there's a lot of magical places there's got to be some wonderful Magic to coming to some of these places to coming to a lake that has been sacred or to a well that is sacred do you have any particular areas that you like to go to where you truly feel oh yeah this place this place is Magic oh so many um I think I always shock people because having grown up on Angley there's a joke that we say a lot on the island especially the Pagan folk we tend to say this joke which is you can't kick a rock in Angley without having hit somehow an ancient Monument here and there you know you're going to kick a rock and then you'll find out that rock is actually a 3,000 year old rock from a tomb that was just down the road or something everywhere you look there are just these ancient monuments that extend back into prehistory they extend back thousands of years and kind of tell the stories of the history of humanity in that area and I think people are shocked sometimes because when I refer to the places that are most sacred to me not always the most obvious so I know that um a lot of people that I've taken home with me to give them tours and such because I love to do that I love to take friends with me back to the island and you know just show them around the Fantastical spots that we have across the area and one of the places that was near to me is um a burial chamber called barad AES and bares is very special to me I will say that straight away that this place is special I'm not um saying that it's less special than the other places I'll mention but you know balus is very obviously special because it's a huge burial chamber that sits on a cliff overlooking the sea so you're in this lional place where the land the Sea and the sky are constantly singing together in harmony and it's this huge huge burial chamber that you can walk into it's probably the size of my bloody home on the inside it's just massive and inside are these huge Stones huge megaliths that have been carved into so they have these spiral like structures all over them and walking in there is like walking into some hidden chamber of magic from a fantasy movie straight out of Lord of the Rings or something like that and you know that is five minute drive down the road from where I grew up so people assume that that would be like one of the places that I mention first and foremost when I'm talking about sacred sites and places that I feel strongly attached to and whilst yes like B gaes beautiful gorgeous it sits on this Cliff that's between two Coes so it's also on the beach and it's just amazing and my mentor my old Mentor Julie or lettuce we used to call her um she used to take me there and we used to practice Magic on top of it and because it's a burial chamber and it's kind of in this mound shape it's literally a Hollow Hill so it's like a hill on the top of this Cliff that you can walk into and you could imagine fairies living there and such and if you were to go on top of it you used to be able to lie on top of the very kind of crest of the hill and when you lay down there at night on a very clear night when all the stars were visible which is quite rare in Wales because we get a lot of rain but it was possible it did happen every now and then if you lay there and look up you felt like you were in a snow globe or something and the entire Sky just opened up around you so that place is very special but but a place that I personally feel so deeply connected to and it always kind of brings me back to life if I'm in a bit of a rut and I have to like you know try and reinvigorate myself is this place in AB called trind or we called it locally a pig now Tru translates to literally the black nose and there's a lot of um places in Wales that are called the black nose and it's because we have these kind of like black volcanic rock Rock and the uh the peakes or the peaks of these Cliffs and Hills they kind of look like a nose jutting out into the landscape so they look like a nose of Black Rock and so they're called trind there's lots of places called that we called it locally a peig which is just the peak so it's the very peak of the village and it's this one Cliff that kind of if you stand there and you look outwards completely surrounding you if you look in one direction is the sea you can look over the sea to the mountains of Ari the Snowden mountains um if you look around you there's all these islands out in the sea as well and it's just this huge expanse of water and you're on this patch of grass with these volcanic rocks like I said just jutting out these black rocks and the waves are hitting against them beautifully and if you turn in the other direction you've got the island kind of just extending out before you the village in the background looking tiny all these little paths that Meander down the different coastal paths and beaches and such and it's just glorious and there are these little stones on the floor that just kind of jut out of the grass and for years and years and years that place was where I used to go to to practice my magic as a teenager and I used to go there whenever I was feeling low whenever I was feeling down if I just had a fight with my parents or something I'd run over there and I'd just lay on the ground and I would let all my emotions out and I remember once I was speaking to a friend of mine who is very much into like the archaeology of the island and such and I was saying how I'm quite sad that there aren't any like ancient monuments in Abra because Abra is a very historic village and we have like the remnants of an old Roman Fort the remnants of an old castle it's the it used to be the capital of the kingdom of gwith where the princes of Wales used to sit and live and such so it's got a lot of history but not really ancient history so I was like always sad about that and then my friend who you know was very into the ancient archaeology of angles he was like what do you mean it's it's very ancient we have we have like uh evidence of humans living in AB for upwards of 10,000 years like we know that there's been a lot of active uh things going on there and I told this friend about you know the little stones on the floor and such and this place where I can see the LC and Sky again just singing In Harmony and how at peace I feel there and he asked me oh can you show it to me on a map can you show me where exactly it is and I did and I showed it to him and he went oh yeah that's the location of an ancient Ken so those rocks that you're looking at are actually they used to at one point form a stone circle that went in a circle and then there was a pile of rocks in the middle and it would have been an ancient tomb and I had no idea about any of this I just used to go there and feel that kind of spiral of energy that existed there and never knew that for thousands of years the ancestral people of this lanscape have been going to that exact location to honor and to scatter the remains of their dead so it was literally a place of reverence for thousands upon thousands of years and so that place is always the most sacred place to me it's the place that I feel most at home because it's not obvious it's not like BR ores these kind of burial Chambers and standing stones and stone circles that are really obvious to them to the eye that look like you know Stonehenge and ay and such it's a very subtle place and I felt I must have felt something there to have this deep feeling of comfort there and yet I had no idea until this friend you knew without knowing you knew without knowing absolutely I knew without knowing and the place must have revealed its story to me on some kind of energetic level long before I ever knew it for certain and since then I've looked into it further and deeper and connected to it on a much grander scale but it's just that that Sensation that feeling that I must have tapped into something much older than myself as a teenager and it's still so important to me to this day makes it just that much more special I think it's those connections that we make without knowing that can sometimes be very very deep you know and I love how you said that there was a spiral of energy because I know that a lot of the Old Stone carvings and things will be spirals you know there'll be spirals in a lot of the old artwork and when you talk about fairies or fairy magic it circles and spirals so I I think that's very cool that that that that's how the Energy felt to you was It was kind of spiraled up into you you know it that makes a lot of sense with how I understand magic works with that being said that you found you know some very cool spaces you can't kick a rock without finding literally kick a sacred Rock um I know you like to also collect hag Stones is it true that hag stones are a way to see fairies by looking through them or is it a protection from fairies have you heard any lore like that about hag Stones so it's kind of both and this is the thing with fairy folklore in general it's something that um I try and make clear in the book but also just whenever I talk about them is that when you're looking into fairy folklore it is filled with contradiction so much contradiction so if you find a book that tells you you know and this is just an example this is not true at all this is just something I'm making up off the top of my head if you find a book that tells you fairies always have green skin you will find three other books that will go no no fairies always have blue skin fairies always have green skin fairies always have yellow skin fairies always you know it will completely contradict each other and I think that's something that people don't really necessarily value about fairy folklore is just how contradictory in nature it is because it's we we can't within our cultural context within the modern world we can't comprehend that because we've had literal you know not just decades we've had centuries now since uh people like Charles Darwin created the classification of the species of Earth and science is now at the Forefront of everything that we do and science is obsessed isn't it with classifying things and compartmentalizing them and being like this is this and that is that so when it comes to Folklore you can't do that very neatly um you can't really put things into those boxes and be like this is this that's that we've classified this as this because it just doesn't work and you see it a lot with fairy folklore when it comes to the names we give fairies you know people who are very interested in things like Dungeons and Dragons for example might find it really odd that a goblin a troll a elf and and fairy they're all the same thing in folklore they're all very much the same thing it's just different terms depending on region depending they're not like you know they're not species terms they're not things that we use to separate different species of fairies it just depends on who is labeling them what the story's focus is and what period of time it was being told and it's the same for these little Traditions like with hag Stones so in the modern day you see a lot of people talking about how they are kind of portals or gateways for the eye to look into the realm of fairy so that is true there are some pieces of folk CLA from not just in Wales but across Britain that talks about that very idea that you know they act as almost a spy hole or a peephole into the world of Looking Glass into the fery yeah yes exactly and it makes sense because um when we look at the folklore behind you know where fairies live within a Welsh or a Celtic context they often live in Subterranean abodes so they live under the ground under the stones so the idea that looking through a hole in a rock um to see into their world to see things clearly makes sense especially when you compare it to stories of like there are many stories that talk of people who accidentally find their way into the other world by walking through caves and things like that and what is a hagstone but just like a tiny version of a cave isn't it so it makes sense that that's there but then we also see these folk magical traditions where people will um gather hag stones and they will tie them up onto their bars or onto their front door and it'll keep fairies away so it's kind of like in a very contradictory fashion they are both tools that will help you see into the world of fairy and connect with fairy but then there are also things that keep them away as well and we see that a lot because like there's also um one of my favorite ones is with the plant that's called G so we have gor that grows everywhere across the coastal paths and the rural like Headlands of whales and such and they're these prickly plants with these gorgeous yellow flowers and if you ever pick the flowers and kind of rub them between your fingers and then sniff they smell like coconut and it's amazing and um they're all over and a lot of farmers see them as either a nuisance or a help because they can act as kind of a hedge or a path or a or a um kind of a barrier between the different fields and such and then when we read about them in folklore you have some stories that are like oh the fairies love the GS they love it so much they wear the lovely smelling flowers on their headdresses and on their hats and such and then you find other stories that are like they hate the GS plant so much they hate how prickly it is they hate how stabby it is and so if you ever want to keep the fairies away put gors in your windows and such and they will not come near you so it's it's really fun to look at these kind of contradictory ideas behind fairies for everything that you will find that definitively says a fairy is this you will easily find 20 other books that says the opposite and yeah some people might be frustrated with that but I love it I feel like that's a way to get in trouble with the fairies it's almost like you don't really know the rules and that's where things go Ary oh definitely now you mentioned a couple ways to keep fairies out of your house I know a couple more so keeping in mind the fact that this will be both true and not true let me know if you have heard of any of this lore and if it if it really applies or not so I have heard that if you have a if you make a wreath of oak leaves and ivy leaves and put that outside your door is that something that will keep fairies away oh it's not one that I've particularly heard um especially because when it comes to the oak tree the oak tree within a Welsh context is actually sacred to the fairies they dance underneath its branches on um full moon nights and such and uh so Poss that wouldn't make sense okay so how about I've also heard if you put a broom or a Bome bristles up outside your door that the Fay won't be able to come in because they'll be so distracted counting all the bristles on your broom that they won't come in the door yes I've heard this one and it it kind of it relates to a huge uh plethora of superstitions that kind of uh work in the same way and what we'll see with ones like that where they have to count the bristles of the Brom is you see this parallel then between fairies and a lot of beliefs in a more Christian context surrounding demons we see the same thing kind of happen there um there's you know In some cultures it's believed that salt will keep demons away and in our culture we kind of just assume that that must be because they don't like salt they just don't like the the the component that is salt but in some cultures the reason they can't cross a line of salt is for that same reason because they get distracted and they have to count every single grain of salt um so yeah I've have I have heard that one um to go with the tree one as well it's really interesting because one tree that's really really important within a Welsh cultural context for keeping fairies away is the Rowan the Rowan tree or I think in America at some point it was called the mountain ash and such it's it's a tree that has these like gorgeous red berries the Autumn and it's believed that they are very sacred um very very beautiful and magical trees that will Ward away the Mischief of the fairies and you'll see often in um old houses in Wales where they've built kind of the house with in the front garden or sometimes in the back Garden they'll have two Rowan trees going as if it's making a kind of Archway by the front door to keep them away um but yeah that one is interesting to me because there's a parallel there with what we see in England so in England we they have the the same kind of belief that the Rowan tree is sacred but rather than fairies in most parts of England they say that the Rowan tree keeps witches away so it's kind of like oh you see that parallel there between Witchcraft and fairies again right I guess anytime they're lumping any time of mischievous spirit in there we get tossed into the mix I think yes well we are a good time at a party you know MH one last thing is I've heard you should never tell a fairy your real name I've heard that yes um it is true so it's it's kind of a complicated one because it goes both ways so within um obviously I I can only speak for my culture with any Authority but within Welsh culture um it was believed that names in and of themselves hold power they hold power and they hold you know some kind of authority over the person of which that name belonged to so it was very important that Spirits fairies any kind of Otherworldly uh entity did not learn your true name or else they have power and dominion over you especially if you give it of your free will if you literally just tell them my name is this and it is yours like for example some people might do that with their gods in modern paganism you know they might say I dedicate myself to you but if you were to say I dedicate name to you then that's giving them power and dominion over you but what I find really fascinating about our stories in particular is that we have similar stories where this is reversed where finding out the name of a fairy also grants you power over that fairy so um it's very similar to the story of Rumple stiltskin where you know you have to find out Rumple stil Skin's name in order to be able to you know have any power over him or to stop him from doing what he's doing we have similar stories with fairies here specifically there's one story about a fairy called Penelope and she was um abducted and captured by a mortal man who found her very beautiful and wanted wanted her he lusted after her basically and she said she refused essentially to do anything for him or to live with him and he begged her and begged her to marry him to be with him and such and she said I will never fall for you unless that is that you find my name then I will be powerless in your presence and you will own me and he ended up accidentally finding her name which was Penelope and once he knew her name she could not leave his house she was under his Dominion then so it kind of goes both ways this whole idea that names have an inherent magic to them an inherent power to them um and you know it's it's one of the reasons not to not to get too personal now but I I often get people who will message me and such on Facebook or who will just make these Grand blog posts and such about me which is really odd um they'll make these posts and they'll be like Mara can't be a an authority on Welsh things and she must be lying about being Welsh because the name Mara Starling is not Welsh you know the names Mara and Starling aren't Welsh names and I always have to turn around and go number one I am trans and I did change my name so this is not my birth name and number two have you never heard of a n diplom you know an name and there's a reason I don't my real name exactly it's like a magical name Mara Starling is the name that I've chosen to go by publicly doesn't mean it's my true name it and that's what I always thought about magical names is that that people selected a magical name because they didn't want to you know like I don't necessarily love my birth name but it is mine and it is my own but I also have a magical name and and I keep those to separate and I feel like my real name like you said is kind of a sacred thing whereas that magical name I kind of would use more out for me more out in a in a magically public setting I know some people would do it the opposite but it it's kind of like keep that to yourself you do have power even in the real world in 2024 people do have power if they have your name absolutely and that's kind of the way I see it so yeah that's definitely a thing the the name thing and it's something that I've kind of taken very on board when it comes to giving names out and such I also think that names are very powerful I do think that the act of taking a new name whether it's for a magical reason or a personal reason whether your life has changed whether you have changed or if you want to go in a different direction in your life uh one common way that people change their names when their life has changed is marriage there's big reasons to take names it's always a big decision when you change your name and so there's a lot of power in that and having multiple names I know a lot of witches have many many names for different parts of who you are you can name different parts of your personality like shell says she has her legal given name that she has a relationship with and then she has a magical name but she uses those names in different settings I just never knew it was it went both ways I thought it was just if they knew your name you had power I didn't realize that if you found out a Fair's name it was that same exchange of power yeah and it it's very similar to um so there's this common Motif within not just Welsh law but also in Irish and Scottish folklore and even in some European nations and such they have this idea woven into their folk claw surrounding fairies of the fairy bride which is you know the the fairy Maiden who marries a mortal man and in those stories sometimes the fairies have some kind of magical skin so we see that in stories of like the selis or the swan maidens and things like that you know they'll have a skin which can help them transform back into animal form and throughout their entire existence they are um constantly looking for this skin because it'll set them free and such you don't see that so much in Welsh folklore we don't have like as much of the animal transforming fairies but what we have instead is either this naming thing where you know fairies will not be abducted and be married by Mortals unless they know their name or there's usually a taboo placed on the marriage so we have like the idea that you know a fairy will marry a human but if that human ever touches her with iron or if that human ever abuses her physically that's it they're gone then forever they get to return back to their fairy home it should be a rule for anyone I think really yes definitely absolutely just quickly that you mentioned another um another I don't want to say Superstition but you mentioned another folklore piece with the iron cold iron I hear it referred you know you should bring cold iron near the Fay is that a thing oh definitely we see it in stories and it it can be very obvious very um kind of clear in the stories there's stories where women will place an iron bar across their baby's  or sometimes and this sounds dangerous so I do not recommend anybody does it but sometimes they'll take a pair of scissors or sheets that have been made out of iron and they'll hang it in the in the shape of an ex above their baby's so these were ways of yeah these were ways of trying to avert the fair's attention yeah to keep them from stealing the fairy babies away you see it similarly with humans who have like a bit of paranoia mortal who have a bit of paranoia about the fairies perhaps coming into their homes so they'll keep an iron dagger under their pillow we have also within a Welsh context there are these fairies called the Guan which live out on the mountains and they're described as being these almost like Haggard looking old women who wander around the mountains and they can lead you off the the beaten path and into dangers way into Peril and such and a lot of I be when I grow up by the way same very much same so The Travelers on these Mountain paths would often have a iron knife that they'd keep in their pocket ETS and if these Gua never appeared before them all they had to do was pull the iron knife out and the fairy would basically vanish into nothingness um similarly you have like the iron horse shoes being placed above doorways not just for good luck but also to keep things away so yeah iron is definitely one similarly the lock on the door as well you see that a lot in Welsh folktales where if the fairies are kind of pursuing and attacking somebody running after them and chasing them all they have to do is run into the house close the door and Bolt the iron bolt across and the fairies can't cross that doorway then so yeah iron is definitely one that we see a lot when you were working on your Welsh Fairy book did you seek out experiences with fairies did you go to places that could have been a fairy to say did you seek out experiences I guess is my question in kind of quote unquote researching the book and if so what were experience oh yes so um to kind of go on to that question one thing that I want to address is like this idea because it's something that gets pushed around especially on Tik Tok and such lately is this idea that fairies uh are something that we need to kind of stay away from that they need to be left alone to their own devices we want nothing to do with them they're scary they're you know all of this and I have to kind of address that and say that when it comes to the historical context of magic within a specifically Welsh context that's not the case you know we don't see this whole idea that fairies are almost these scary boogey men that you have to keep away from all the time um what we see instead is this idea that and and a lot of people will come forward when I say this and say well if if we weren't wanting to stay away from them why is there so many different things that you can do to keep them away you know and my answer to that is always well that was for the common people that was for everyday people the people who were making these charms in such and telling the people to do these things were magical practitioners you know the people weren't just getting this knowledge that iron is you know something that'll keep them away or Rowan will keep them away they weren't getting these ideas from nowhere they were getting them from people who were experienced magical practitioners having those experiences exactly and in a lot of these stories when the fairies cause mischief and Mayhem and harm to people's lives the first person they will go to for help is the cunning woman the witch the magical practitioner so I always turn around and I say yes it's true that Mortals for the most part stayed away from fairies because they were scary they were volatile they could cause all sorts of Chaos in your life but it's a completely different story for those of us who dabbled into the magical aspects of life people who practiced magic were said to have a very specific relationship with the fairies they had to understand the way that the other world operates the way that fairies operated and we have within Welsh tradition a whole Corpus of magical practice associated with connecting to and being in relationship with fairies we even have grimo from like through the centuries that um magical practitioners kept with spells and recipes and ingredients and methods of reaching out to and connecting with fairies so for me personally not just for the research of this book but the Fair folks that all with t have always been an inherent aspect of my magical practice they've always been there at the very Forefront of it all and it's very hard not to be that way when you are a Welsh practitioner because even our gods are usually very much of that same realm they're of the same idea and concept of the other world as the fair folk are so if you are somebody who's terrified of fairies and you you're the type of witch who sits at home watch ing Tik toks and you'll say to someone oh I don't mess with the fa they're too scary but then you have an altar set up to the goddess Ranon that's a bit contradictory because Ranon is an otherworldly Maiden she is by definition a fairy so you are working with a fairy in that instance um so Ranon is that strange bridge where a lot of our gods and goddesses are very much of the fairy realm so they are by that definition fairies as well so I already have kind of a corpus of practices that I carried out in order to connect with the fairies with the to with t with the with all these different fairy entities that we have within our law but then in researching this book I just found more and more and it's great like how much I came across that is just woven into our culture so little things like you know certain locations that are deeply associated with them um I'm lucky to have very good friends who took me to a a great many of these Loc ations so that I could experience them for myself we went to hin Van which is a lake associated with the Lady of the Lake of fairy who came and married a mortal man and such we went to various sacred Wells that are associated with fairies and hilltops and all sorts of things we also crafted so I found in an old grimoire um I found this kind of method of associating yourself with fairies which involves crafting certain wands out of Hazel wood and such so we crafted wands out of Hazel I've got a staff of Hazel that I use in my practice and such and so these little things we started exploring not just me but me and my covered and my friends and such we all went out and kind of did a few of these things together and yeah I suppose my practice now is very much linked with that idea of anovin the other world but also fairies in general so yeah definitely sadly we can't all get out to Wales and all these beautiful places that are full of magic but there's a lot of magic in the natural world in any place just like you said earlier things are alive the Fay and the magic and the energy is all around anywhere that you are so do you have any tips for someone who wants to maybe connect with the Fay in their home or in their yard or in their local park if they want to connect with that type of energy or bring that into them do you have any tips for them on how to connect to that my main tip always is to get to know your square mile so get to know that area that you live in itself um I know it's probably preachy of me to say so but this is one of the reasons that I wrote my first book like my first book Welsh witchcraft was written in part out of frustration because I knew so many witches in Wales who were deeply deeply attached to the idea of connecting with gods and Spirits from like places thousands hundreds of miles away and I used to always get frustrated and go what about the spirits here what about the ones on your doorstep are you connecting with them and a lot of the time they would turn around and they would say well I don't know enough about them you know there aren't as many books on Welsh deities and Spirits as there are on say uh you know Greek or Egyptian or Roman or anything like that so it was just easier for them to connect to those gods and goddesses and spirits and such so I always turn around and say the first thing is look to your square mile which I know and understand acknowledge and appreciate that for somebody who lives say in the United States or in Australia or Canada or anything like that it can be a little daunting to approach because for a lot of people especially people who have skin the same complexion as mine you know you're living on Stolen land essentially and it's good to acknowledge that and appreciate it um and also kind of reach out to the custodians of that land to the people people who lived on that land before your ancestors got there and ask if possible if it's possible to do so what are some methods of connecting to the local Spirits in a respectable way you know and I know it can be difficult especially in that situation but beyond that as well I'm always struck by how much was actually taken over the sea as well because when I talk about Welsh fairies I'll often get little messages where people will say oh we have those all the way here in the Appalachian Mountains we have those all the way here in the back places of Australia and such I wouldn't be surprised the Appalachian Mountains range is pretty weird I would not be surprised at all if there's a connection there absolutely and it it's very deeply connected because you know we have not only similar entities by name but also similar entities in essence as well so we have in Wales these uh creatures called kir or kobai and the kir or the kobai are these mining en ities that live beneath the Earth and they knock away at the rocks and they are sometimes a little malevolent but for the most part it's quite benevolent um and then when I talk about this so many people are like we have those in the Appalachian Mountains I live in Pennsylvania we have the knockers in the mind oh my gosh yeah exactly so when it comes to connecting with things like fairies or spirits of place there's already this Corpus of belief that's built up in your area probably so like that like the knockers in the mines and such what have you done to connect to those you know is what I will always say to people tap into that exactly and you know can you find out more about the folklore of those beings and how people used to interact with them if they interacted with them at all in the past so for me it's always a a huge task of getting to know your square mile what is around you look towards your square mile and get to know not just the landscape but also the stories of that landscape and what's woven into that that place because that will always open so many doors you know talk to the older people who have been around for a long time talk to the trees for God's sakes you know we do that as pagans so go off and find out what magic lives in your square mile and that one little piece of advice will usually open so many doors that things will become much clearer then that's phenomenal I absolutely love that we are big proponents of find the spirits in your place find the energy where you're at worship the season where you're from not from halfway around the world but but look to your I love that your square mile your your range that's that's a beautiful way to look at it Mara yeah that's gonna stick with me know your square mile yeah Mara thank you so much for joining

create a lot of free content online across my socials and you know it depends on what kind of things you're into if you're into flamboyant chaos then my Tik Tok is the place to go if you're interested in having a bit more of a you know serious chat about these things then my YouTube is probably the best place to go um similarly I have you know an Instagram and I share a lot of posts on there about the local area so if you want to see pretty pictures of Wales that's the place to come find me as well um I do have a patreon my patreon is a paid membership platform it's you know you pay whatever

classes and courses I also have essays and worksheets and all sorts of things on there that people can look into you can even watch full length documentaries on there and such so if you do want to come and join us you also get access to a community of people a Discord server and a Facebook group and all sorts of things like that you get to talk to not just me but a whole community of people who have an interest in these kinds of things then you can find me on patreon and then my books can be purchased pretty much wherever books are sold Welsh witchcraft is already out now everywhere you can buy it on the usual like you know online places like Amazon and such but I would say support your local book sellers and go and ask them to order it in if possible if they don't have it already they

give me a little of that energy that's I don't even know at this point I barely sleep I just like to do things I just love being around the witches and pagans it's fun it's a lot of fun I agree the
