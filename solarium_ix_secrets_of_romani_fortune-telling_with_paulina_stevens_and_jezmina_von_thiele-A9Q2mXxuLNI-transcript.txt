for having us we're so happy to be here we are very excited to have you guys here because we were fortunate enough to get an advanced copy of your book and we fell in love that's all we have to say we absolutely love it and I want to start off by saying this isn't NE necessarily like I understand the concept you know the secrets of the Romani fortune telling but this book is like Universal for anybody who's looking for tips and tricks and advice on Divination in any form like this this is all of a sudden one of my top divination books because this is so fabulous I love this but we'll get into the wise thank you yeah I'm loving that right thank you so much oh you guys are very welcome I did find out that the podcast is kind of how you guys met is that right oh yeah we're on year three it's crazy congratulations tell us a little bit about how your guys's relationship has evolved and a little bit about what you talk about on your podcast yeah well I love when Paulina tells the story of how we met because it really started with her so I was hoping to get something started either a podcast or you YouTube channel or something I wanted to just kind of spread the information because at the time I had left my community and there were other girls that were kind of reaching out that were like hey like you know I went through the same thing and blah blah blah so I was like I don't know like what to do and I came across a video I think it was a YouTube video where jez was talking about just Romani rights um and just advocating for us as a people and I felt like it was kind of this different point of view so I had originally emailed them and we just yeah you want to take it from there yeah yeah and I Paulina I feel like you're leaving out some of the um really crucial part of your story I would love to hear a little bit of the backstory about that Paulina tell our listeners a little bit about your history because it's fascinating what brought you here yeah so I grew up in romanic community and we're kind of our specific subgroup of Roma people that came here my my family is a little bit split like so we have a couple of different vas um which are like subgroups that have kind of joined together so we had come to America around the late 1800s kind of um also then during World War II as well and we kept a lot of our Traditions like pretty close and it so I wasn't allowed to go to school or when I did it was just not for long or it wasn't really important or because the law required us to or just something like that and the reason why I mean it the book also explains like the details and the Deep kind of rooted things that you know created the the dist trust between us and like the government basically so yeah our community stayed pretty close it and I was raised to be a fortune teller so I wasn't allowed to really have another job at all like I had to be a fortune teller you know selling crystals candles this this like stores and stuff like that it's just something you can do wherever you go you can do it you could you know read for people on the street can read for people on Affair you can just kind of do it wherever you are and so um yeah that's what we were raised to do and then when I say left the community it's just kind of my specific Community you obviously can't stop being you know your eity or your race like you can't really stop that part but yeah so it's kind of I left my specific community and we are trying to I guess create a little more inclusive space for people inside and outside the community and I feel like Jess really also brought a different um much needed perspective um to the podcast and just to our work in general and that's really what you were doing when you were reaching out to Jasmin you reached out to them more to help create this whole community and to help create a new community from the one that you had left definitely and yeah one of the best phone calls I've ever made or emails I've ever sent however it went down Jess what's your story so yeah when Paulina reached out to me um she had left her um arranged marriage just maybe like a year or two before she was asked to do a podcast um with the LA Times a series called foretold that I highly recommend everyone listen to just about that whole experience and we also talk about it in the book and Paulina wanted to make sure that she was doing something that was coming from her you know even though she participated so much in foretold it was still you know another podcast telling her story and it made her realize that she wanted to have her own platform and um but she didn't want to do it by herself and initially when Paulina reached out to me I was in such a strange time in my life um so I grew up mixed and assimilated basically for for any listeners who might not know Roma uh refers to the Indian diasporic ethnic group also known as gypsies which you know has been used as a slur a lot in the US it's also a misnomer um because it comes from the idea that Roma come from Egypt rather than India and it's one of those words that a lot of Romani people will reclaim and use really proudly some don't I grew up using it in my family but pretty much across the board Roma prefer that people who are not Romani don't appropriate the word Gypsy and so as a that's my little decide so I grew up mixed and assimilated meaning that um I'm not from an entirely Romani family my dad is not Roma only really my maternal grandmother is Romani but uh we were so so close she was one of the most important people in my life my favorite person really I just adored her and she passed down um her culture and her practices to me as a small child and she had fled Germany after the Holocaust and um it was still unlivable there for Roma and um any marginalized people Jewish people but also just you know average German citizens like a war torn country it's really hard to live in yeah so my grandmother passed down her relationship with the Roman culture but my relationship to the Roman culture is fragmented I grew up outside of community versus Paulina growing up inside community and so we had this idea that we would really like to um create a podcast that told Romani stories and uplifted Romani people from all different walks of life especially Roma who maybe feel like they don't fit in for whatever reason so lgbtqia people like disabled people maybe folks who decided not to get married or left there marriages or you know pursued education or maybe are doing a traditional trade and want to talk about that and so basically you're trying to read you're trying to reach out to everybody who's had your experience paulina's experience everything in between yeah Paulina called us like the the outcast of the outcast and I was like oh that's perfect so we have our whole little RIT where everybody can come and just be part and be who they are and still be part of community I love that totally now how did how did the podcast transition to to the book because you've had the podcast you guys are doing really well and now you've got this fabulous book that is ready to hit the world ah thank you yeah I mean so wiser had reached out to me a few years ago and I was very very ill at the time and so I was like because I I had long covid I still do but I'm making improvements and so yeah it was it's been weird but um you know I was like let me please be patient let me think about it and they had originally asked for a subject that I wasn't sure I wanted to talk about because so much of it is closed practice so I pitched to them you know let's talk about Romani divination because that's something that is mainstream and we would really like to add cultural context back to that but I wanted to write it with Paulina because she's my creative partner I love our two perspectives and as the podcast is evolved we become such good friends even though we didn't know each other at all and so I just couldn't imagine doing it without her and I love how you wo I understand you didn't want to get into closed practices but I love how you wo so much history and culture and and your personal histories into this book while keeping it chalk full of practical things that people can do different divination Styles you you explain them in such an accessible beautiful way while keeping true to your culture I guess while keeping all of that there yeah and it's it's so nice to have a book that can lend the cultural cont context of you know tarot is definitely created by the Italians however like Roma created it as a divination tool and this is part of our survival and um it's nice because these things have become Universal but we're trying to add the cultural context back to it um so people don't do things maybe accidentally like you know dressing up like the traditional fortune teller or something it's actually dressing up as a caricature of a Romani person and so we can all like be so excited about all the ways that we connect and we have SIM arities while also being really respectful of histories of persecution of cultural um sacredness of survival practices and like honor and call that out and name it and that's such a really good point that you make very subtly throughout the whole book that there is so much history and culture here and so much of your own personal history but that's also what makes it so very easy to connect to so very easy to find similarities like for example with our grandmothers with learning palm reading you mentioned your beloved grandmother that you learned from chess and and I kept seeing things from my childhood reflected in your childhoods like one of the things you talked about I was talking to Shell about this beforehand is you have a chapter in here on palmistry where you talk about the different types of palmistry and you both mentioned being taught different meanings for the hands my grandmother was a more of a spiritualist she didn't do any of these things she was not a fortune teller by any stretch but she enjoyed them and she taught me with pestry that your dominant hand that's your future right that's your future and your non-dominant hand she said was your fate at Birth and she said your non-dominant hand would never change but your dominant hand would change over your life as your you know chance and choice change things now you guys each had learned different things about that can you tell me a little bit about learning from your grandmother yeah my grandmother had such a funny way of putting this and so um the way she put it was well your dominant hand uh and if you're ambidextrous you know whatever hand you tend to write with is your life like that's your life now and it changes and your non-dominant hand is your past life and my grandmother did believe in past lives and reincarnation in her opinion the past life was over it ended you're dead so like stop thinking about it like get over it so she didn't want me to read the non-dominant hand because she was like well that's just ridiculous but I I kind of love that like never look back but yeah and Paulina had a different perspective on it yeah Paulina what what what was your experience with with learning some of these Traditions from family what's interesting is that I feel like i' like so many people have mentioned different things I think like originally it was like okay you're non-dominant hand and then you're dominant hand or it's like whatever you're feeling or you read both of them if you need more context so that was kind of I don't even know if I mentioned all that in the book but that's definitely what it was like and I love seeing the different perspectives you know and how it's so similar and yet also so different and and I think that was another thing in the book that was really good is is how you talk about reading tarot cards and oh gosh I'm not sure which one of you it was somebody said that there were so many different decks of cards in your home that the deck that you ended up reading with Not only was like in not so great shape but had cards from all sorts of different decks in it that was me and it's funny too because I think jez mentioned that they really like that story too um I love that like do you do ever do that on purpose like I purposefully have some Decks that I have mixed different Cards into is that anything you ever do on purpose now um I've never yeah I've never done that on purpose um I don't know it's it happens even now it happens so often like so many random cards like I'll see random cards on the floor and I'm like how in the world does this even get here how did this happen like everything is just mixed up everywhere because it's so intertwined with my life so never on purpose Always by mistake but is it really by the universes exactly exactly didn't you have an experience once Paulina where you pulled out like four Tower cards yes and I still think about it and I still get nervous sometimes like card like remember like I have PTSD oh my goodness yeah that would scare me like one is bad enough four of them no I'd hide under my bed I'd be like stuffing crystals in my bra and everywhere and hiding so much change so much change ahead and change is scary man towards the latter half of the book there was a bunch of that really grabbed me and I like you guys's perspective and and what you had to say about these topics and the first one I just want to get a couple opinions from you both on the ethics of fortune telling I can't remember whose grandma gave the list of the moral and ethical code so to say but I love grandma Yeah I love good that's so good and I think again another piece that is valid information for anybody practicing divination no matter what your belief system is and tell us a little bit about your rules I'm calling them rules but they're not rules per se but tell us about the moral code of conduct when it comes to fortune telling and divination yeah I feel like it can be boil down to a few basic tenants but you know I expand a little more with my grandma's rules but but you know both pully and and I feel really strongly like you shouldn't manipulate whoever you're reading for you shouldn't try to scare them um my Grandma had a blanket rule don't tell anyone they're going to die because I think that sometimes people want to be dramatic or you know I don't know what it is or feel like they can prophesize things but it's really harmful you can do a lot of harm reading for people without that um Consciousness about people's feelings and fears but she also likewise encouraged me to really trust my intuition I really can't doubt what I feel or hear sometimes the things that you might see while you're reading for people might not make any sense and you might not say it because you're afraid to feel silly but one of my favorite experiences was um kind of recently I was reading te leaves for someone and they asked about their spiritual path and they were like just what what do my guys want me to know about my spiritual path and I saw this little pum curled up with all these little baby possums and the tea leaves and I was like and I heard like she's caring for possums and I was like that sounds crazy but like I know better say that and so I was like are you caring for a family of pums and she's like yes and so she had been taking care of these possums as a kind of devotional to the land that she was living on because she found these possums that you know didn't have a good enough shelter and they were hanging around she's like let me like get them a little area and I like oh yeah that's a that's a really big part of your spiritual half is is caring for animals and you know I've had other moments like that too but you know she was really big about just saying saying what you believe it's okay don't get your ego involved in it don't try to manipulate people don't lie um and just basically remember that you're of service and it's not about you you're just trying to help and you know my my take on that has always been this isn't a set in stone future or you know a rock solid prediction but anything from this moment on can can be changed and and reshaped and that's why I never like giving you don't tell people yeah you know you're going to die next week you're going hit by no yeah no and and it I I loved your listing and I thought that was great and and your next lead in um which I also again how to be convincing I can't remember which one of you it was that was just kind of started at like 13 thrown in rooms of people to read how do you be convincing at 13 how is this a confidence thing is this a you got to believe in yourself for people to believe you is that really the basis of that by the time we hit 13 it's like we already know you know we've been trained already our whole lives like until we can talk and so I feel like by 13 it to me like yeah like you're totally confident you've been in the rooms and you've seen it your whole life now you're just the one you know sitting in front of the person and what's crazy too is I feel like we are how to uphold ourselves so even when I was 13 like people thought I was older they would like well you carry yourself you know like so old or whatever it is but also even when you're clearly young you know nine 10 years old and you're at a fair like reading for someone whatever it is it's such an interesting industry like a spiritual message can totally come from an eight-year-old or a 13year old like it's the spirit world it's not really like you're I'm not going to let an eight-year-old you know do my root canal but um I wouldn't mind the tarot reading or something sure now didn't you also mention that that you you practiced a lot they would have you maybe with an uncle or someone read palms or give them little mini readings and and I think that that's such a good point that practice really does make perfect and reading for someone other than yourself can really help to grow your ability you can read all the books out there but but you have to do the work and you have to do the practice and you have to come up with what different things mean to you in a reading and what different symbols May articulate to you specifically yeah and I'll tell you guys too something that I didn't mention in the book was sometimes the like uncles or aunts would give a an example like a different Insight so it would be like pretend I'm you know a 19-year-old girl or pretend I'm an 80-year-old man or pretend I'm this pretend I'm that and that was also really helpful for me to feel comfortable being in a safe space of like oh well I can pretend everybody's kind of messing around and they're also giving you tips where it's like oh like you're not going to be you know that soft of a voice like when you're talking with someone maybe you know older or you know far away or they can't hear you or maybe someone's really emotional like you have to have you know then you do talk with a softer tone like there's just like weird little things that I feel like I didn't think about how much helped me to throughout the process but um they totally did now Jas me I your story intrigues me to no end I actually am from and grew up in Middle Upstate New York so I I get that Farm Life um that I'm not currently living and to hear that you were put in a horse stall like I know that fear like I've experienced that I'm just thinking to myself you used animals as a way to kind of hone your skill um well sounded like maybe horses specifically to hone your skill I never thought of that but how amazing so give our listeners just a little tidbit about about your your younger days of practicing divination with horses yeah so you know because for Romani people fortune telling is one of our many survival trades so because of the persecution through centuries since Roma left India um our work has been really limited and so we take jobs like this really really seriously which is why you know we start learning when we're like 4 years old and practicing on family and so my family um wasn't as big as paulina's and um my dad side the family um yeah for whatever reason we just never practiced on them and so when I had run read for everyone in my family and I had read for their friends and I felt comfortable with everyone uh in New Hampshire in the 9s and early 2000s um it wasn't really popular it was a little too weird to have a fortune teller and so you know I would do that sometimes but my grandmother and my mother were like you're not getting enough practice like we need you to you know because it's it's a real thing it's a real job you're 13 already gotta get out there and so um my mother and my auntie Zena um were working at a barn and they would teach riding and you know get show horses ready for things and sometimes show horses themselves and uh there were so many problem horses that maybe they were you know great horses but they were afraid of something or they were lame for some reason no one could figure out or they were really grouchy or like would like to bite people in the face and they just had all of these issues and um their owners had sort of exhausted all the options and my mom was like let's let's give this a try um if you're really intuitive you should be a to read animals and um so the my first test was being put in the stall when I was probably like 12 um with a horse that was notoriously biting and kicking everyone and my mom was like a very tough person so she was like figure it out and so I had to do my you know my meditation outside of the stall and I was trying to connect telepathically with the horse to just you know let him know that I was there to help and I wasn't going to you know try to make him do anything I just want to know like why he was so grouchy well like what's going on maybe I can help you and um because I was 12 I really wasn't second guessing myself at all like poina was saying like you just have to be confident they teach you this confidence you just believe in yourself and so I went in there and I put my hands on the horse and asked if that was okay and immediately I had this flood of information from this horse that was biting everyone in the face like no one could deal with this horse if I'm correct it's byy mck kicker that was the nickname I gave him was so scared of bitey mck kierson and I was like I'm going to get kicked to death and but you know he really actually just wanted to complain to me and so he was like I do not like the music it's too loud and he kind of like I looked up and there was a little radio in his doall he's like I don't like the style of music and I kind of like heard classical music in my head and I was like oh he likes classical better someone must have played that once and he's like also they sing in the morning I don't like the horse next to me he just like had this long old man and so when I left the stall and I told it owner everything and I told the barn hands everything they were like I mean we'll try it and then he was fine no biting no kicking you know perfect little gentleman going in and out of his stall and so then I had all this business at the barn and I got a lot of practice I love that as an animal lover I love that now Paulina you you learned a lot as a child in your family from your family as well but you had this time where where that wasn't the right life for you and you had to you know kind of leave that and what was it like reclaiming that it has to be very difficult to you know to leave it behind and then to also kind of come back to itrace it yeah can you tell us a little bit about that Journey yeah um I will say that I think growing up I have to backtrack a little bit because ethics weren't they were taught but it was more like you don't take food out of other people's mouths and kind of like stuff like that it wasn't as like basically the line definitely blurred and so I would say that that was one reason but also I mean I was in a place where it's all I was allowed to do and so I felt like this you know I'm G to get a corporate job and I'm gonna like you know live the American life and like I want a 9 to5 I'm G to take the weekends off because I was working late you know I was working all the way 900 p.m. 10 p.m. 11:00 p.m. like the fortune telling world is an entertainment industry for sure and so yeah I did the nto5 and I was just like I don't know like I need you know I needed spirituality and I learned so much about my people learned so much about my culture there was just so much more that I came back with like when I did come back to it i' also went to college and I studied biotech and I was like I don't know why but like so deep into the scientific realm it intercrosses with the spiritual realm so now yeah like totally like once you reach one side of the spectrum like you're on the other side of the spectrum at that point like nothing exists and everything exists so you really went out the science route you went completely opposite your upbringing and then that brought just like science and Magic it brought you right back totally it brought me right back and I do find um my experience I think has totally helped me throughout the whole process so I feel more confident like I can also write emails and be a fortune teller or something one of the other things I loved throughout this book was you you guys talked a lot about your family you talked about your ancestors and you talked about doing a little ancestor work and also dreams um which to me a lot of times it seems to me that when I hear that people who don't necessarily believe that their ancestors come back to them they will say my loved one passed away and they came to me in a dream you know you hear that so often very common yeah can you tell us a little bit about Dream Work and a little bit about ancestors coming to Dreams yeah I mean I I think Romani people in general um you know there's there's always diversity in our group but a a lot of Roma believe that dreams are really significant it's something you should pay attention to that Spirits uh Spirit guides ancestors can all speak to you your own intuition you know deity spirit and so we do pay close attention to our dreams and talk about the symbols that come up and in both penid in my family you know animals tend to indicate some sort of premonition or indication for the future or for your fortune and for some Romani people you can have visits with your ancestors that are kind of like neutral loving maybe they're giving a message other times um we believe that they are like coming to bring us to the other side and so it can depend if you feel like that's a a signal um that it's time to go uh or if it's just an ancestor visiting it's interesting cuz I um one of my a so my auntie Zena who um I just absolutely adored and most of my Romani family passed away over the last couple of years like one after the other very quickly and um yeah it was really hard and my auntie was always the kind of person who if I was having a bad time at school she would just kind of come pick me up and be like we're going to the beach and I'd be like okay bye so she was definitely like oh you don't like it let's bail and I was having a really really bad day one day and I said to her out loud I was like H auntie I can't take it anymore and that night I had this dream that I was going to the darkest like region of the world and I was getting all these like messages from my friends to not eat the food and to wear a Cod because I would die if I ate the food all this stuff and I ended up at like this nightclub because my auntie loved to dance and um and she was ushering me in and she was like come in eat with me dance with me and I was like oh I can't eat or I'll die and she's like eat with me and I was like oh no she she heard me she heard me say I'm tired of this she's coming to get me and my dog actually jumped on my chest and barked in my face and was like wake up and I was like oh and I had to have a little chat I was like Auntie I am not ready I I am just dramatic you not yeah auntie thank you love you but not right now yeah so yeah it it varies you know I think some times people can read really heavy into dreams and even even if it is a spirit coming to get you you can often negotiate or talk do you have anything that you recommend to if you wanted to reach out to someone in your dreams or if you wanted to reach out to an ancestor Paulina do you have a preferred way that you like to do that like how you like to approach your ancestors I think what's so crazy is I find the similarity similarities because it always comes down to food some way shape or form like always come down to food so like you put out their most favorite things you light them a cigarette you just kind of like their coffee is really important coffee for some reason is super important water and yeah their favorite things and you just that kind of like calls their spirit and then you can technically do a little ceremony if you wanted to with some frankincense and bread where you light a candle and you light the um frankincense and you just kind of take it around the table and say some things and it like calls your ancestors or your spirits to you so yeah I love that and and I love how you brought up the similarities because you know we were just talking about you know the the Celtic celebration of sin is coming up and they very often do like a silent supper and and food is a big part of that to call their beloved dead and to to have that and I just love seeing that across different cultures seeing all those different similarities because our ancestors are spirits are the same the world over you know and they all like the same kinds of things so I think that's very cool um now you you also mentioned you know leaving out maybe a cigarette for your beloved dead and I noticed one of the things you guys have recipes and good spells in your book you also have tea recipes which shell and I love and smokable recipes as well which we are both very much into so I I do like mixing a tea blend to do work or even mixing a smokable blend to do spell work can you guys tell us your experiences with herbs I think that you know for both Pina and I we grew up just learning about herbs and spices in medicinal ways and the magic of it was always just very practical like you know the things that were considered lucky are also really healthy for you like you know hot pepper and garlic and you know lemon and all of these things and so we came up with some recipes that we're just with herbs that we're familiar with pina's family is super into lavender and so a lot of her recipes are really lavender heavy mine is really into like the chamomile and the lemon and my grandma was always interested and kind of like so I run pretty anxious actually po it is too we're both very anxious so lavender and chamomile is perfect a lot of our recipes are about like bringing the energy nice and calm and smoothed out and so yeah we just shared some of our favorite recipes things that we've tinkered with and we have some really simple ones we have some more complex ones and um both Paulina and I really like to integrate um you know smoking and smoke um into our our personal ritual so we thought that would be fun to just introduce some of our favorites I was pleasantly surprised to see that I did not expect to see any recipes like that here but I was I was very happy to see those because I I think herbs and incorporating them in teas and smokables is is a wonderful way to bring them into your practice so I I was very happy to see that in your book yeah and I think that you know we have such an animistic perspective that it's important to remember that we can talk to the plants and ask for their help it looks like there is a a very strong animistic perspective in the Romany beliefs can you tell us a little bit more about that yeah we we really feel that um everything has a spirit you know and again we can't really speak for all Roma you know but Pina and I grew up this way and I think it's sort of the old way of doing things but you know people might have converted to different religions have different perspectives absolutely um but yeah we were I mean both really raised with this idea of being respectful of all living things of plants and even inanimate objects like you know a lot of Roma will apologize to bread if they drop it on the floor because bread is so important to us and so it was just a way to move through the world with respect but also to remember how connected we are to all life and our relationship to the land especially being historically nomadic is um much more of a relationship rather than ownership and so I think that really permeates everything that we do and again that's something that definitely translates to multiple cultures multiple societies and and I think that is one of the things that I learned the most from this book is that you know everybody's kind of really just doing the same thing they're just tweaking a little bit different dep depending on region culture upbringing and and and things of that nature we're all doing the same thing here now do you have a a favorite form of divination Paulina or something that you prefer to do definitely again like I think I might have said this before but like I hate saying this cuz it feels like it's so overplayed like and and over marketed or something in society but I think tarot is just really easy for me I agree 100% yeah like I could do a lot of other things but it's just like it's just it's fun you know I like looking at the pictures I like all the different cars and the pretty colors and all the different artwork and it's just it's kind of a favorite I grew up with it and I feel like it holds like there's Deep Roots and deep history in there and I think that's what I connect to poina I have a side question I have a side question you you talked about having a lot of decks now one thing I need to share is I am a terod deck collector and I am adct addict she's a Tarot de addict shush yourself and I have about 200 decks right now are you a fanatic and what is your favorite deck because I am I I don't even use them all honestly I use two or three but it's the pictures and it's I just love Tarot so are you a fanatic A and B what is your absolute favorite deck to use gosh I feel like I wish I feel like my real answer is going to disappoint you a little bit but I would say that so basically I would say that I love the writer weight deck just because it's what I grew up with and so I know like you know once you learn the right way you can learn everything else so I always like myself going back to Ry aweight but I really feel like I could pick up any deck and just kind of use it like right in that moment but I also I mean I don't even know all the correlations to like a regular playing deck but for some reason I went to a party and I gave great readings all night with a regular playing card of deck and I made it some side cash like just kind of you just kind of learn it but I love that you're a collector my mom totally collected and I'm sure she'd probably have a better answer for you but for me I feel like it's just any deck in the traditional probably Rider we just because it's always there I did the opposite I refused absolutely refused to touch a right or weight deck for 30 years until like what Ila two years ago and now that's the deck I use her favorite yeah but I never touched it until recently yeah your it's your favorite now I'm using it right now I I always go back to the witches tarot uh that was that was put out in the early to mid90s that is my all-time favorite but currently I am using the um the rer weight Smith deck okay I love that you we're actually hoping I mean not hoping but we're working on our own Tarot deck right now o very nice that's exciting we'll definitely have to let us know because I will need to I will need to obtain a c to add it to her collection just mean it same question for you do you have a favorite form of divination you know it really varies on who I'm reading for and why like I definitely feel like they they all have their Specialties tarot is so good for what's happening right now the Palm is so big so good for the big picture and your personality and but I do I have a special place in my heart for Tea Leaf reading just because um I love the ritual of it and I love how personalized the symbols can be and I just have such good mem memories of reading for my family that was everyone's favorite in my family so that was when everyone got together and read for each other and we got to gossip and it was the most fun
