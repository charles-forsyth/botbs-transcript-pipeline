welcome to back on the broomstick a modern witch's spoken word grimoire where two witchy friends from way back are reconnecting to their Pagan Roots after a long period of mundanity we're Rew walking the path of the wise and trying out all the latest spells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your wand and your incense your cauldron and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick hey witches welcome to back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I'm shell and today we'll be talking about magical names and using a magical name and why you might want to use a magical name and how do you get a magical name what's in a name that's a good place to start what's in a name what is in a name let's start there have you yourself sh ever had a magical name you know I've actually had a couple I know the answer to this I was gonna say you bestowed like half of them on me Jes right you know I didn't realize the whole magical name thing until shortly after I met you and I was like oh wow people do that and the first one I had when I was first initiated into witchcraft in retrospect I would not have said this at the time and you know that because you were there and I never said this but at the time I was like why am I doing this and it kind of was awkward I have a name this is the name I've been known by for forever and it was weird to me to have a different name but then I kind of shed that skin after several years and and went on to the next name which kind of better suited me but still wasn't my name if that makes sense it makes total sense names are very personal and very powerful and I'm someone I attach a lot of meaning to names maybe because mine was so unusual growing up I mean the song Leila came out shortly before before I was born and I knew no one else named Leila and now it's like hugely popular which I love I mean naming my children it was super difficult I ended up even not being able to leave the hospital with my youngest because they insisted I name her before I left and I didn't know yet like I had list upon list Oh you mean you're not a Kardashian I think one of them just got named and he's like a year old oh wow okay cool yeah I know now that technically I could have left and named her later but at the time with the pressure I didn't know but names are super important to me they mean a lot I have two middle names and I made sure that both of my girls had two middle names because again a middle name is more like your private name your secret name like a secret name yeah exactly and we'll get into the reasoning and the history behind why people have a middle name sometimes both mundane and magical reasons now do you think let's let's start this off because there has been some jabber on the internet and social media that you're not a witch if you don't have a magical name so I want your opinion because I think that's a bunch of hooie it is a bunch of Hoy my name is my name just like you said your name is your name and I'm very attached to my name I go in magical Circles by my mundane or regular everyday legal name Lea you're just Lila we don't there nothing more is needed I feel a little bad actually because at the past belain that we were just at in in the Mysteries C we were introducing ourselves and someone introduced themselves by their original magical name which they said they had outgrown then they introduced themselves by their current magical name and I introduced myself as I'm Lila I'm just Lila and in retrospect I feel like it may have sounded like a jab against this person who had gone you know talked about all these magical names that they were using and and then I come in and I'm like I'm Leila I just go by Lea and it wasn't it was just no it came out it didn't come out yeah and so I feel a little badly about that because I do like magical names and I do see very good reasons very good magical reasons for having a magical name I did have a relevant conversation in my Monday and work life um in last week or so that's relevant to this I am in a human services type environment a person came in and I said could I get your name please and the person said you can call me and I just kind of tilted my head because you know somebody says what's your name well my name is and that was not the response the response was you can call me such and such I like that I want to start using that you know I just kind of tilted my head and I was like oh okay but I'm thinking that kind of goes along with the whole thought of a magical name your name holds power over you and and we can talk about some myths in a second that go along with that but but this guy I don't know if that was his birth name on his birth certificate I don't know I was told to call him such and such and I think that goes the same with magical names you know you want to be called something that doesn't give someone the right to try to pry into what your birth name is and just like you said names have power and when I was coming into being a witch there weren't a lot of books around they just didn't really exist and so I took a lot of what I knew to be true about magic and what I wanted to be as a witch from history from Reading different traditions and learning about different cultures that when someone became an adult they would take a new name or In some cultures at every step in your life when you change your name changes and that that really resonated with me and that fit and I wanted to take a magical name to declare that I was a different person now that I had come into this newness this new being of being a witch and so I wanted to take a witch name my first witch name I took from a goddess I took the name kedwin and she's like the goddess of witches goddess of inspiration of Rebirth of Science and prophecy and these were all qualities that I wanted to see in myself I wanted to see in my practice I wanted to declare that I was a brand new witch and I thought that kedwin as a name to kind of embody those ideas was the perfect way to start that and of course as a brand new witch I went way overboard I put that name on everything it was lased in stickers on the spine of my very first book of shadows and it was because I I I liked that energy I felt in touch with that energy of kedwin and I wanted to embody that which is I think something that's a little different in magical name sometimes we take it not just because we've entered into a new phase but sometimes it's something we want to be right or an energy that we want to bring into our lives so a lot of us will take magical names for all sorts of different periods of time you know it's funny because there are certain circles that it's like if you don't have a magical name you're not there yet we laugh at that and and we should laugh at that and I hope our listeners are laughing at that because if someone's telling you that run yeah run as much as I love names and I do take magical names for different reasons you don't need one it's not necessary you know you can certainly be a very magical person without one um a lot of people back when we started took a magical name for a very practical reason and that was because they were in the broom closet maybe it was a secret that's exactly right it was a secret you didn't want anyone to associate your witchcraft your religion with your mundane life your job where people I guess even today are under very real threat of losing their job losing their children yeah losing their house because of their religion and so having a magical name that you are known by in magical circles could protect your mundane and you know quote unquote real world identity all of that 100% agree but in the same respect is a magical name necessary absolutely not if you want to be Jenny From the Block inside your circle rock it um you don't have to be grandmas pooa guir you can be Jenny in the circle you know I mean names have as much power as you give them I do believe in the tradition of a secret name because I do believe that sometimes we have in some magical Traditions knowing the true name of something its actual true name not necessarily your legal name but your true name the name of your soul the name of who you really are if someone can say your true name then they like you said they have power over you and that's something that you'll hear in fairy Traditions I think it's kind of a myth that it's in Celtic Traditions but I've heard that before that might be a silver Raven wolf thing that's a little controversial I'm not sure but I have heard that that's a belief again particularly in fairy Traditions so if someone knows your true name they can have power over you so some people will choose a name that only they and the deities that they worship know but that does kind of coincide with the previous point of you know that name can Shield your personal life if you face any sort of persecution for what you believe yeah exactly and I think they're fun I do I don't need one and I certainly don't use like I don't introduce myself as a name I I have a hard time with that my name is ilila it doesn't shorten very well into a nickname I've never really had a nickname the only time I ever had a name other than Lila that's stuck that was actually felt like my name was when I was a camp counselor for a summer all the counselors went by a name other than their legal name and I was Gypsy for a whole summer and that fit it does it does but that's not a word that we use now because we know better but anyway nicknames are one way we kind of do that in modern-day Society people have nicknames and we know a lot of magical people just by their magical name like I can think of a woman who went by Freya haale The Traveler but I have to think about it to think of her quote unquote real name is yeah yeah you know but Freya was just as much her real name exactly exactly and some people do embody that they are able to choose a magical name and just go by that and be that person and I agree it's just something for me personally I find a hard concept to grasp just because you know I've gone multip mle decades with this name right right but I have chosen and I did choose the name kedw when I first did my dedication ritual way back in the day I picked that name and that lasted for a couple years until I chose something different because I felt I had grown as a person and that to me um seems to be something that holds true for me every few years I'll pick a new magical name and for me it's usually something it's more like a manifestation it's kind of where I am and where I want to be not necessarily just who I think I am at the moment it's more I want to Manifest this energy right you know like say someone who chose the name wolf or Raven or you know there's a lot of common themes U moon or luna and it's usually because that's how they feel that's the energy of you know what they feel and and that's perfectly valid but I like to choose something that I want to draw into my life that I'm trying to an energy that I I need coming up in this cycle or an energy that I feel is lacking in my personal life now real quick I just want to I I want to talk about and see what you think about the crossover between your magical name in the mundane world we see a lot of people whether it be online or in person walking down the street that are using their magical name on the dayto day and they are getting some sort of discrimination based on that and I sometimes even as a witch have to wonder why in bloody hell are you going out on Main Street USA and telling every Tom Dick and Harry your magical name I'd be like yeah my name's Bob my name's Bob you know like my very first magical name and I I I haven't used this in a good 20 years was imman now I was not by any stretch walking down Main Street telling people excuse me what's your name name please my name's ammana you know I just wasn't doing that the crossover between spiritual space and mundane space to me were just two separate things and so those names for me had no business crisscrossing you know and I do think it's very valid some people only use that name in magical space some people only use it with their coven or only if they're in some type of ritual or Festival situation with other pagans but there are people like I said the name earlier silver ravenwolf she's a an author from back in the day very prolific author and that obviously is her magical name so for her to use that name her magical name is part of who she is in the mundane world and so she uses that you know all the time a lot of people take a name a professional name and so in that case that's kind of became her professional name so I guess it really depends on what your point of your name is because we take names for all sorts of different reasons and like when you get married you take on a new last name possibly or you maybe you come up with a name together to take and that's a a tradition that you know that marks a time in your life that marks a momentous occasion some people when they get baptized into a religion or inducted into their religion just like pagans take a new name it's it's pretty common so you know I don't necessarily have a problem with people using their magical name in mundane space but it defeats the purpose in a bunch of I guess it depends on what the purpose is of having that magical name is it your persona is it who you know your public Persona that you're trying to be or are you just using a name that's supposed to be secret and magical and putting it out there so I don't know I guess it would depend on the point of the name what your angle is with it yeah yeah where you're going it do you use a magical name now currently I do not although I've been thinking more and more about it because as we've been kind of Rew walking this path and doing this I've been thinking more and more about taking a name taking a magical name because I am doing more magical things and being Witcher with my life and so I I kind of do want to it's not something I'll probably share with anyone I mean with you I'll probably tell you but it's it's not something I will ban it around go to a business and someone says well what's your name I'm not gonna be like well you can call me the crow Queen you can right I'm not going to be like you can call me but it depends if at the fairy Festival I might say that I mean I don't know yet if this is just going to be a private magical name kind of like a manifestation for me where I'll pick a deity or an energy that I want to embody or I want to bring into my life and I will choose that as the name and kind of use that to help me in my magical workings but I might I mean I've thought about it I do plan on going to a lot of festivals this year and I did kind of think about having a magical Persona Festival Persona that I could kind of I'm shy you know I want to get out there at these festivals and I was thinking maybe if I took on a festival name a festival magical name that that might help me break out of my you know typical shy introvertedness what do you think of that I think that's actually a good idea and you know where I'm at a lot of people have character names their Street characters especially during October when Salem is just a Nut House you know you see some of these people on the street without the makeup and in their street clothes and you're like hey but yet you don't necessarily approach them when they're in their street clothes by their character name right and in their character you wouldn't approach them by their street clothes name some of these folks it's almost like a switch when they turn into that persona it's like they're completely I don't want to say completely different person because I'm not trying to say that in a bad way but it's a different side of them like they embody that character right right right there is something cool about that I think there's something very magical about that and I think that's kind of exactly the point that we're making is that sometimes you can take this magical name and then that can help you in magical spaces embody that energy you know if I know that what did you call me the crow Queen yeah if I am the crow Queen you know if I say hey I'm Crow Queen you know maybe that helps me to feel that energy maybe I feel more free maybe I feel more magical you know maybe that helps me as I'm in ritual space to really tap into that that subconscious that Alpha energy you know maybe it might help me feel more magical and engage in a more magical way just like you said kind of embodying a character you know kind of being in that kind of space any way that you can get your head into that head space is going to help your magic be more powerful I I think that people really need to look at names as a additional tool I think that's a that's kind of a good way to look at it in in in the context of magic just an additional tool I love that it's definitely good now I know you've had more than one magical name and I know some have been given to you which can happen some traditions will bestow a name upon someone I believe in our coven we did that more than once when someone was initiated in we would give them a name it was usually a name that we had discussed with them beforehand you know we knew what it fing surprise right but we would give them a name these names had a lot of significance you know again they were picked to represent the person represent who they were magically who they wanted to be magically and in the future what deity maybe they worked with you know we took all of those things into account when choosing a magical name have you ever picked a name using numerology no actually I never even knew there was such a thing I think I spelled the name kedwin weird you know like one of of those parents who has to have the really wild spelling of their kids names right and the reason for it was because of numerology and I'm pretty sure it was um buckland's Big Blue Book yeah the big blue book Big Blue Book buckland's Big Blue Book buckland's big blue book in I still have that damn thing I love that damn thing I mean I am not Wiccan I know we are not Wiccan but we read it it's as a primer as a basic I gave it to my kids my kids each have a copy it's a fabulous basic for everything and and you know you have to take some of it with a grain of salt and rewrite a lot of it but it's I love it foundational book love it in it there is a section on names and I haven't looked at it in a million years but I know that um he uses numerology where you assign each letter of the alphabet a number like a is one B is two that kind of thing and you add them all up until you get it down to one digit and you do that the same way with your date of birth and you can find what your your number is what your birth number is and each number means a different thing so I remember I was supposed to pick a name that matched my birth number which is four by the way and so I picked I spelled the name all weird so it would match my number oh Lord right you know I do like things like that because it fits math I love math and I do like things that fit and kind of make sense like that for me magically it helps and so different numbers mean different things so you can pick a name that has a number that matches maybe the vibration or the energy that you want and so that can kind of help make it more meaningful for you so that's one way thank God my birth number is also four so that you can go through some names and I'll just pick the one you don't like right didn't we at one point you know that song Isis a star he de didn't we at one time have everybody in the coven's magical name set to that I think we did all I remember is and feo I remember that that's all I remember poor Foo good times good times times yeah that's the only one I remember but yeah I mean I I think that if it works for you go with it but if it doesn't work for you do not feel bad whatsoever yeah I think it used to be more popular than it is now or maybe that's just me I don't know I I do remember people in the past introducing themselves by their magical name much more often than now now I see feel like I do feel like nowadays people have much more interesting names so maybe there's less of a stigma on being a pagan or a witch and so people don't feel the need to hide it as much that could be I do see on social media occasionally people asking about magical names and how do you get a magical name it's kind of like how you be a witch you just you know you pick one just like becoming a witch you just say you're one when we had our Cup in C gloma we did do some name giving ceremonies and things of that nature so you can be given a name absolutely but do you need to be given a name no it's like a Tarot deck you don't have to be gifted this crap just get one pick one exactly and I don't care if it's a flower if it's a deity if it's the name of your favorite character it really doesn't matter as long as it has meaning to you personally I like to have a name that adds something to my magical practice either helps identify where I'm at or where I want to be in my magical practice so what do you think about this magical name for me I think my next magical name should be Stevie Nicks what are you trying to embody there sh like witchy goddess awesomeness I think apparently yeah yeah I think that'd be awesome we could just call you snicks for sure that's actually funny that's actually funny that's good that's good one book that I was recommended repeatedly that I have not yet read but I've I've heard great things about is called the witch's name crafting identities of magical power by storm fairy wolf you know it definitely has some of the the history how to choose one how to claim one they can definitely be a help to deepen your practice if you want one but like shell said you don't have to have one and I've certainly practiced for years just being just Lea and just Lea but then you and I have never had really a problem in the mundane World being worried about being out so that was never a concern we never really cared about what other people thought about us we don't really with demon magic or fairy magic you know anything like that where you would need to keep a true name hidden you know so that's not something we'd really need to do so other than just doing it for personal growth reasons it's not it wasn't really our bag but for personal growth I love it magical growth I think it's a great tool people ask sometimes you know how do I get a magical name where do I get a magical name how can I think one up wow so I checked out this site you're gonna love this fantasy name generators. so it gave me a couple of names I just want to put these out there and let see what you think okay Helio Frosty field no too Frosty you don't like the cold Helio I that's Sun so that fits but no Frost okay next snow drop Misty Brier well snow drop obviously still wrong Misty Brier too sweet no no next orange shine how do you say orange shine it doesn't go well orange Shrine orange shine NOP nope sorry too much of a tongue twister don't like it listen to this one n nutmeg silk Ray I thought you said nutmeg silk Rag and I was going to be like oh yeah that's shell I like the nutmeg part this one I think this one really embodies who I am okay this this website got it spoton with this one flicks Sparkle griddle go nutmeg Sparkle griddle and I I I think you've got it I think You' nailed it right there that's your magical name nutmeg Sparkle griddle okay we have a winner here folks we do but I mean you can pick a stone amethyst you can pick a the name of a star you can pick the name of a deity one thing that we did in our coven was I believe you had a book of like 10,000 goddess names the 10,000 goddesses and the 10,000 Gods yeah yeah and we would kind of open that up randomly and just see where that led just be careful folks because I have a PSA for you if you pick P there's consequences okay continue but that kind of proves the point that taking a magical name can really bring those energies into your life because if if you pick a deity Choose Wisely because that deity will then pay attention to you if you have chosen that name and so be careful whose attention you catch you might want to choose a derivative of that name or maybe there's a name that's bouncing around in your head I've heard myself being called a name in meditation before you know meditated on what that meant and why and done divination on it and then realized that was actually my name and went with it but if you're going to pick a name you know do your research first because at one point in my past magical circles um I met a person who went by ranan and the girl hated horses oh yeah that's a little disconcerting I don't know this for sure I'm speculating but I think it was one of those oh that's a pretty name I like it I'm gonna pick that and like didn't know ranan you know I me right and I bet that person had conflict the entire time they used that name name because they themselves are at conflict with part of who that deity is you know how I am I'm just like oh so you love horses right no I'm like wait what I just like the song Good Luck you should research the name you should know the name research your own name I know a lot of us have looked into what our names mean what our middle names mean and I think that that's important to know because that is the energy that you're going to bring if you choose the named wolf you're going to probably be surrounded by friends and family and have to start taking on more responsibilities and working within a group and you know I hope you want that energy yeah right and if you choose pay there's gonna probably be a lot of change and a lot of foundational shifts and a lot ofup fire and disruption and energy and growth and that that could be difficult maybe you're not ready for that I he in with the new yeah exactly do your research because as much as names can be pretty and beautiful the whole reason you're picking it is because there is something behind it there is something that you want out of it and maybe that's why the Kardashians took a year to choose the name for their kid because it is important right and I know people who have chosen a name for their child and then later gone through the steps to legally change it because they realized it was the wrong name have you ever met people that don't match their name or do match their name like wow that's such a Steve thing to do you know you're so Steve all these Steves that you meet are so much the same right down to the little quirks like my theory of name Association yeah so is the name dictating a little bit who that person is or was that person given that name because you know somehow the person knew it was going to match their personality I don't know we still love all the Steves out there we're not knocking everybody new Steve I do love you Steve you're great we are talking about people who take um a magical names but here's one for you um Mark Twain that wasn't his name happened to be you know he happened to be um from around where where where we're from so we know that that's not his name his name was Samuel Clemens but you're not gonna find a book authored by Samuel Clemens they're all authored by Mark Twain so kind of like as maybe a celebrity or an author would take on a pseudonym kind of think of a magical name almost like that pseudonym that an author or a singer would take on that pseudonym I think that kind of helps them embody who they want to be you know a rock star or a movie star or whatever and we can use that in a magical way for who we want to be sometimes it helps people to shed their mundane lives you know if I'm just Leila going into circle in my regular work cloth sometimes I might not feel very magical and in order to properly do magic you have to feel feel it you have to be in the moment and so if I step into Circle wearing a long pretty robe and I have a circlet of flowers and my hair and I'm holding some pretty crystals and I step into the circle and I say I am what did you call me Pro Queen Crow I am the crow Queen and step into Circle I feel powerful I embody that Crow and Raven energy and I I feel like a goddess I feel like a magical being and so sometimes that can help people shed mundane and step into their magical ritual their magical lives just as you would not necessarily wear your work clothes to Ritual you may not necessarily want to walk into that space being Susie Smith you know exactly you know Susie Smith might want to be storm thrower or whatever you know and and to feel different and to feel more magical in that space to take on that name some people take on ancestor names if they're working with that energy all of those reasons are very valid and very powerful if you doubt that names have power call someone by their entire name first middle and last and see oh my kids know I ain't playing when I start whipping out middle names yeah that's some magic and power right there I gave you that name I can take it away too that's right we all get a little scared when when somebody starts whipping out all the names right so here we got a letter
