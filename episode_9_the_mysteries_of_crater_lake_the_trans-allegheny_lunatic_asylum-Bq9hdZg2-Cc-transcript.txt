brother and I and our family bet on Super Bowl teams and my brother and I were the only two that bet on the Washington football team and they won so I've kind of been fan of theirs ever since I know it's dumb but for for as long as we've been friends I actually think you don't know this fun fact my daughter is a huge huge Washington fan that's fantastic I actually the other day when they came out with a brand new whatever name commanders they're the commanders I sent her something I saw online because I was like wow she's the person I know who would give a [ __ ] about this me me me me I care

shell my longtime Stoner friend is liking it this much I'm growing that [ __ ] yeah so I'm growing it I got some we're gonna call it shell the shell special I I think that this is definitely a good one for for you to give a give a good go to you're going to buy seeds anyway so why not try this one but nice nice it it's it's definitely a good what is that strain cultivar it's a nice cultivar yeah a nice cultivar I'm trying I'm learning the words just not necessarily the proper context of them yet well we're getting there though yes yes you are yes you are man but you know what you like you've always been a you've always had a good nose for weed you know I don't is that a good tra what's a weed somier is that something that people do like what would you call that like a weed somier you know what I'm talking about right like the person who recommends wine like uh connoisseur a cannabis connoisseur oh I like that title I could do that I'm definitely a cannabis connoisseur a cannabis connoisseur um I'd never be a good bun tender because I would be licking my fingers and like I just I wouldn't be good they would be like stop yeah they would they ask for what's good you be like oh I had this the other night and it was fantastic oh and I had this one too and it's really great head high lick my finger them lick at my finger see how great it is it's okay so my mother-in-law has a brand new boyfriend it's always good when mother-in-laws get new boyfriends I totally agree and he's wonderful oh my gosh he is just an absolute sweetheart I'm so happy for her spoils the heck out of her which drives her crazy right so they're in Vegas and they're lucky [ __ ] right but she comes up to me now she's normally not a pot smoker occasion a hit now and then but she comes up she goes Lea Lea do you have any rolling papers and I'm like whoa hey yes I do mother-in-law I do have rolling papers and I go what kind do you want and I whip out like four different kinds of rolling papers and she's like no no because only you would have four different kinds she's like no no no I don't have rolly papers will you roll me a joint I'm like what you want to take a joint to Vegas okay okay all

no no what'll do just one you know you know see what a lot of people out here have been using maybe this is an East Coast thing not rolling so much anymore but buying the cones m in packing the cones I like that but I ran out of cones and I have so many papers because I get them for free a lot of times with our delivery but yeah I love the cones do you pack yours I don't pack I actually just buy pre-rolls already ready to just light that buddy up but I do like I think they burn better with that cone shape as opposed to that you know that pregnant joint that is like falling apart and you're like V and weed off of it as you're taking a hit I I just think the cone is a better smell I like that too and oh check out my joint holder do you like this I love that I actually have a mint holder that's the same thing okay so it started its life as a mint holder with little the little planet the little planet shaped mints same thing is that what you have too no way what yes show me but I so we both have a tin with a Ouija board on the top of it it says mystifying mint but I have not eaten the plant me [Laughter] either oh Lord I have the same thing but I use the tin to keep my joints in I just can't bring myself to eat the planett I feel like I have not even opened it summon some damn demon in my [Laughter] belly yep same thing same thing that's too funny yeah so I will admit when I made that one logo I was looking at this and I'm like you know that looks really cool I'm gonna make a logo the stoned Witch is our just like my mystifying minc Ouija board tin so what you're saying is you you are really high looking at your joint tin zoning out zoning out on Cana like this is so cool so yeah if you want to check it out it's the background logo on our YouTube episode zero the stone Witches Hour yeah check that's my stoned uh artwork inspired by mistifying mins but you know you know how you resolve all of that finding the right papers get my cheap ass and go get some cones is what you're say no you actually like I've said in many episodes glass pipe all you need in your life is a glass pipe you can't go wrong with a glass pipe I love a glass pipe I have a [ __ ] ton of glass pipes I have so many glass pipes because I tend to have them get all dirty and then I'm like oh this is too clogged I need to buy a new glass pipe and then I get a one story of my life I had one and and it's missing and I'm so sad my two favorite pipes one I broke oh my gosh I found this glass blower I have to see if I can find his name and stick it in here later but he's amazing uh do you remember have you ever seen my woody pipe the one that looked like a wood Branch yes yes I love that pipe I broke it we were going to La Hoya for the day to go snorkeling and packing everything up and I had my bag with everything in it and it fell out and I [ __ ] broke it and then this other one my big fat goddess pipe and that was missing I hate that so it's missing all that all that means all that means that some fairy took it and it is going to reappear and it might even reappear half full of weed you're probably right when they're done with it it will come back I'm pretty sure exactly I would not be surprised it's very very pretty pipe but do you have any predictions for the Super Bowl like who's gonna win I don't know who's in it that's how much I don't pay attention to football other than obviously LA because you're excited but the other team I don't know right it's the LA Rams and the and the Cincinnati Bengals what are they called Bengals the Bengals yeah what's that's is that a cat yeah it's like a tiger okay they're orange and black that suits you that's good okay yeah okay so I'll go with Ohio all right all right what do you think they're gonna win by whatever a touchdown is I'll say Ohio by one touchdown win now I just would like to give a little little note to all of our listeners here please don't think that I'm a horrible person because I know nothing about football if we were talking about hockey I would be on this in hockey every goal is one point one goal one point one goal one point like well hockey makes sense right that's why I love hockey donate blood fight bonie go rangers do not tell do not tell my my my other half fat oh uh oh is there a hockey rivalry in the family there there is that's tough mixed families like that can be difficult shell yeah and and and it's pretty rough because it's the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers and you know I am steadfast go Rangers go let's do this I'm on your side you know that right yeah but you know I love the man love the man but hockey's hockey you mentioned Dennis bonve great hockey player used to love him in the 90s he was in the New York farm team in the AHL team for New York do you want to know what Dennis bony does now what does he do now he acquires hockey talent for the Boston Bruins no way how funny what a coincidence that is fabulous no I remember at the height of uh they had t-shirts that said donate blood fight bonve and and there was a time there was a couple Seasons where that's all anybody went for was to see him fight somebody which really isn't why you should go see hockey but for a little while it was a big thing that's what made my kids start to like hockey was Dennis bony fights my son still loves Dennis bonve so if there is anybody from the Boston Bruins out there Dennis bony if you're listening I would love to see a Bruins game because right now that is financially Beyond me they did make hockey fun I I do admit not just for Bon there was other great players there and and we did love to go watched them so that was yeah and and you know there's nothing like inperson sports that's the other thing you know I'm not a huge TV sport fan there is nothing like walking into a hockey arena or or a baseball stadium or like that but it's just TV just doesn't give you that same zip it is a lot of fun even if you're not a sports person just to go see something like that in person just the vibe of it is just fantastic and a ton of fun are we here to talk about ghosts and paranormally stuff we are here to talk about ghost and paranormally stuff tonight I have a pretty interesting story over here on the West Coast what you got what's going on over there well we're going over to Oregon so we're going to the Northwest up into the Cascade mountain region I'm GNA like hit this pop back to my homegrown by the way this evening I know nothing about Oregon other than I've seen pictures of their Sea Coast and it looks damn fabulous a lot of it is absolutely gorgeous excuse me cough to get off right remember when we used to say when we were younger if you're not coughing you're not high yeah we did used to say that that's true that's because what we were smoking was the worst crap in the entire world yeah those were the days they had been pressed into some weird flaky brick and then stuffed inside a tire and traveled across the entire us to get to us anyway so what's what's going on in Oregon so in Oregon up in the Cascade Mountains is a place called Crater Lake National Park and just like you were saying it it's another place in Oregon that is amazing just this absolutely stunning place I have to hit this my husband has a bunch of Keith on the top I want it to keep burning can't waste that oh cannot waste that so in this National Park is a mountain and at the top of this mountain is Crater Lake and what Crater Lake is basically what's called a Caldera and a Caldera is a crater that's formed when a volcano blows the top off so that oh that's scary why would you swim there well the it happened about eight six to 8 thousand years ago judging um they've dated it and it's roughly 8,000 years ago which interestingly the Native American the people around there the kayath tribe which includes the kayath the modok and the yuskin which I hope I'm pronouncing all of them correctly they have some creation stories that talk of a cataclysm that happened that um could roughly concur occur about the same time as this explosion that formed the lake so after this mountain exploded and formed a Caldera snowfall over thousands of years have filled this and have created the most Crystal Clear Blue gorgeous Lake that you have ever seen it's over 19900 feet deep it's the deepest lake in the United States no [ __ ] 1900 feet and it's either the third or the ninth deepest in the world I found various thing accounts but it's the deepest lake at 1900 feet in the US you lose your bracelet in there swimming you ain't getting that back well you're not going to swim because it is freezing cold the waters while beautiful are bitter bit cold the whole place is gorgeous but very inhospitable the the beaches are Rocky and and it's volcanic Glass and Volcanic Rock and very sharp and again the water is formed from snowfall which makes it super pure and beautiful but also bitter bitter cold who died there oh everyone so I've told you that the clay people have long had this place in their Legends and they've even talked about a cataclysm that happened again roughly about the same time as this volcano blew up and formed the crater cannabis break yeah right one of their legends that I found and again this is you know kind of second and third hand but I did find a legend where supposedly a a clay maath woman was at the top of the mountain when it blew up and she was had been waiting for her lover and you can supposedly still hear her cries on the Wind when the wind blows through across the lake that's creepy so although it's very beautiful again it's very inhospitable and all the Legends around it are bad it's it's basically an evil place they say according to the clth legend they say that the lake was sort of a doorway or a Crossroads between the darkness of the below world and the the light of the above world the clth also believe that if a person stares too long at the Lake's surface that they'll be unable to look away and they'll get sucked into that underworld they thought that the lake had the power to ize or Mesmerize and trap people and even lure them into it towards their death um in the lake there's two islands and the the clath people say that the whole place is sacred sacred good or sacred bad both mostly bad to their way of thinking to Gaze on the the deep blue of the water was to risk quote de death and Lasting sorrow there's a legend that was written about uh this woman Andrea lenford wrote a book about their myths and haunted hikes SP tingling tals and trails from North America's national parks so this myth that she wrote about about says that they have these two Gods Lao who was a god of the below and skele who was the the spirit of above and they were fighting constantly fighting and in this one fight Lao ripped skel's heart from his chest and skele retaliated by dismembering Lao and threw his body parts into this Lake and these lake monsters rose up from the depths because they believed it was bottomless and went straight down to the Dark World so these monsters came up and gobbled up all the body parts of Lao except for his head which created one of the islands that's in the lake it's like a triangular shape like a wizard hat so they call that wizard Island and they say that that's the island that holds um that was lao's head and that the lake still holds his Spirit which is kind of evil and when he's Disturbed he brings up supposedly brings up storm clouds and bad weather around the area um and they say sometimes he appears as a giant crayfish that comes up out of the water to the giant Cliffs the rocky Cliffs that are around it and snatches people and brings them down to their death in the water you know this this has a striking resemblance to many of the Gates of Hell stories we've come across yes very interestingly it does that's kind of why I picked it because you know shells had a lot of Gates of Hell stories I'm going to go with one from out here how many gates of hell are there that's my question how many Gates of Hell really are there that's the question here we kind of need to know this I mean honestly I mean did they did these did these Native American folk kind of use this as like a a place of worship or or ritual or something as far as I can tell they didn't again why the hell were they up there on its Peaks is I guess my question well they were there occasionally and I guess there were um and I'll get to it later but I know they had Berry encampments or like seasonal encampments around the lake so they did go there occasionally but they never lived there very long they would have just like some seasonal encampments there vacation homes right there you go just don't look at the water in this Lake this beautiful blue lake that is one of the most gorgeous spots supposedly that you could go see are these two islands there's wizard Island again it's named because it looks like a wizard hat and that island is rumored to be haunted by the head that's the island they that the clth people say is the head that's right and that island has a lot of ghost stories associated with it the are they are they associated with the guy whose head it is or something different different something different different ghosts so as you get closer into modern times there's a lot of times when people will report seeing fires like campfires which aren't allowed no one's allowed to camp out there there have been reports of people seeing campfires out there even by a park ranger uh this one former park ranger Jan kerwan she said she had witnessed um spontaneous campfires appear on the island and when they go to check it out there's nobody there including one time she saw roughly what she thought was like 10 people off on the island in the woods around this roaring bonfire so huge and she parked her car and went to go stop the people and radioed back for help to get people to come help her because there's like 10 people having a party in a bonfire but when she reached the site where the bonfire was there was nobody there and no campfire no trace of a campfire nothing and she was very distressed because she had obviously seen people and had called for backup to get help and so she was like looking around trying to find them and she couldn't and then when the backup got there she learned from her co-workers that that place was a part a spot where other people have seen campfires and it had been a Park Service Campground decades before and prior to that the clath people had used that spot as one of their temporary hunting and berry picking camps so no nobody there but people see campfires there all the time yeah the first thing I thought of when you said that is it's got to be the Native American Spirits still on their land essentially now the other Island also is mysterious they don't usually see ghosts but the island itself appears to disappear on occasion it's called Phantom Ship Island it's roughly the same width as wizard Island but it's much shorter and flatter it's rough Rocky shape almost looks like an old sailing ship with mass and stuff on it and something about it depending on the weather conditions and the lighting it will look like it disappears from you it just kind of seems to be there and then not there anymore and so it got the name Phantom Ship Island because it seems to appear and disappear like ghost ships oh the third thing in the lake that's really interesting before we get even to all the deaths and the murders uh the third thing in the lake is something that's called The Old Man of the lake and what it is is a giant sequoia tree trunk that somehow has been floating perfectly straight up and down in the lake for over a hundred years no it's probably it's wait no you said it's 1900 feet it can't be rooted what it's not rooted at all they've checked it um it's the tree itself has been carbon dated to be about 450 years old before it went into the lake and no matter the weather it doesn't tip it does not tip it floats straight up and down um [ __ ] no [ __ ] there's about four feet of it that are up out of the water at all the all the time that's Sun bleached and the rest of it roughly 30 feet down into the water is the rest of the tree trunk and it Roots how did I wow there a lot of people would take their picture they'll go out to this this tree trunk and there's pictures of Park Rangers and people standing on the tree trunk as it floats in the lake no [ __ ] he is called the old man and he just kind of Bobs around the lake and sometimes he moves very little and sometimes he he'll move as much as four miles a day and they've tried to do studies on why he moves and they can't really figure it out he doesn't really seem to follow any type of water movement or ties no no there's no real Rhyme or Reason to how or why he moves and there are myths and legends that say that that the old man controls the weather and if you try to control the old man bad things will happen and back in uh I think it was that makes me want to ask you right now has anybody tried to take the damn Fus of wood out no but there were some people that were using a like a submarine to map the lake and the the tree trunk kept bumping into their ship so they used chains to try and tie it up to the shore to stop it from moving and almost immediately after they they tied it up the weather turned bad and stormy and ited to be like that for days until they finally Unchained The Old Man and let him float free and almost immediately the weather calmed and the skies went back to being clear again I want to see this tree so the old man floats around and he's you know pretty popular I pretty sure it's prohibited to get on him anymore but you know he is all of is all of this state park property yes this is a park it's a national park it's Crater Lake National Park in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon okay and it's stunningly gorgeous and you can can you boat in the water like could we get on like a like a kayak and go out to this old man yes you can you can get out on the water and go and see the you can go see the old man you can go out to the islands however the area it's self is it has a rather extensive history of accidental deaths suicides and murder oh yeah it with with almost like was kind of depressing actually how many people fall off the cliffs or get caught in snowstorms and die crash their cars in The Ravines airplanes and helicopters have crashed there they actually have an extensive list of all the people that have died there and all the planes that have crashed I'm not going to go over all them because there's well over a hundred but I'm going to give you some of the more interesting ones it's just weird that like there was issues with planes and stuff because some of them are downright creepy this place this place is Eerie there's something here for sure home of the Gods one of the sadder plane crash deaths here involved a couple and this is so creepy sh just get yourself a joint or something this couple Jeanie and Dave nun so on February 26th 1975 Jean drove her husband daughter and granddaughter to a little airport where Dave was going to fly uh the daughter and granddaughter home in his little blue Cessna along with two student Pilots that were coming with them Dave and the students flew the daughter and granddaughter home with no incident everything was fine and then the three of them started their flight home that same night after dropping them off jean went to bed early and she woke up feeling a hand grabbed her leg around 9:30 p.m. and she distinctly felt a hand grab her on the leg and she looked at the clock and immediately called the airport and told them that her husband's plane had crashed at 9:20 and that he had died at 9:30 the airport that the people on the phone flustered told her yes that they had lost contact with the plane at 920 but that was it they had no other information and she insisted that the plane had crashed and that her husband had passed away at 9:30 wow now the plane was not found until seven years later July 5th 1982 a hiker just outside the park boundary near a huckleberry Campground uh right outside of Crater Lake National Park a hiker spotted what he thought was a a small air airplane and when he approached it he found that it was a blue Cessna and that there were skeletons slumped in in the wreckage oh manam yeah so they had an investigation done and it was confirmed that it was Dave and the two student Pilots so she knew she felt it right she was right and he crashed in Crater Lake why they don't know there was another odd plane crash in 1944 uh these planes called groomin torpedo planes I don't know what they are but they were flying in formation over Crater Lake when one of them just suddenly was gone just disappeared the pilots flying with them just said it was like he was there one minute and then gone the next that's like some Bermuda Triangle [ __ ] yep there was no sign of a crash there was nothing the plane was just gone and it wasn't too long later they did find the plane at the bottom of Crater Lake how they don't know the log of the incident just says that it was as if the lake had snatched the plane from the sky there had been no sign of a crash no nothing when they were flying over it was just gone when you put it that way it's kind of creepy the water just snatched the plane from the sky that's what it seemed like to the pilots you know what that says to me don't fly over that Lake right and certainly don't look at it if you do now how big how big of a lake are we talking like as far as width is this like a mile wide two miles wide like is this like all I know is that it's 1900 feet deep and then there's 2,000 foot tall Cliffs ringing it I don't know it's a decent sized Lake this place is also been home to a lot of suicides and murders and one of the suicides was something called a spontaneous suicide what the hell is that a man that was known by Mr Cornelius he and his wife were touring the lake this was in uh it's in the 70s so Mr Cornelius and his wife are touring the lake when all of a sudden he just hands his wife his wallet and his watch and slid down this like Rocky shoot in the cliff near the old Lake Trail that goes down to the lake they said he was trying to attempt suicide by tumbling down down this slide thing but maybe he thought he could just sled down it to the water or something because when he got to the bottom he had only suffered a broken leg but then the guy crawled across the beach to the water and drowned himself in Crater Lake what the [ __ ] is that about no intent no signs of suicide no feelings according to his wife there was no indication whatsoever he just all of a sudden it was like he was possessed he just all of a sudden handed her his wallet and his watch slid down thing and when that didn't kill him he crawled to the lake and drowned himself so basically what you're telling me is that Crater Lake National Park is a demon portal slash gate to hell oh yeah and not only will it drag you to your death but it'll also snatch you from the sky if that's what it takes and apparently will disappear parts of your body too in 1974 a photographer went out there Charles mcculler went out with his fancy equipment to take some pictures of the sunset sounds like something i' do and he disappeared so he went out there to take some pictures all his fancy camera equipment and never came back his father went out and searched for a whole summer the FBI got involved and searched for him and nothing was found nothing and his dad was just like he would never leave he wouldn't this isn't like him it just wouldn't happen now do you think um that this could be one of those places you know how there are places that have Spirit activity very negative Spirit activity that's kind of stuck there and almost permeates anyone who comes near I don't know maybe I'm not maybe I'm not explaining this right but no I hear what you're saying like it's a place where obviously the indigenous people felt that it had a negative energy it was created by a very violent act and they our mod our modern society does kind of overall think that's a bunch of fooy when in fact it's not right just wondering if this is just one of those very very spiritually negative places that you just really don't want to go to it very much seems to be it seems to be you know this photographer that disappeared his remains were found two years later in 1976 but only his lower half just his jeans and his leg bones and some socks yeah but that's that's I mean that's easily explainable you know there's wolves there's Bears I he was probably eaten by something nothing was ever found no boots no jacket no scraps of them no head no head no other bones were found nod nearby no expensive photography equipment was found near the body nothing it was described in several things as if it was sitting on a log the pants had been sitting there that's weird the ankle bones weren't nod off or or saw off it was just like they were just gone like the feet were just gone Oh weird yeah super weird and they've never found any other parts no jacket no nothing so if animals did there would have been some sort of evidence of of an or at least his heavy camera equipment wouldn't have been too far from his body you wouldn't think and his body was found 12 miles from the trail that he had been on 12 miles and the day that he had disappeared there were seven and a half feet of snow on the ground so if he had left the trail he would have had to hike through 7 and 1/2 ft of snow which he obviously did for 12 miles wow how how did he get there why did he go there yeah maybe he got hypothermia right where's his camera equipment and if he had gotten hypothermia maybe he got lost and went through the snow Yeah but 12 miles in seven feet of snow is a far away and he could have been taking his clothes off with hypothermia but again they would have found that you know there would have been like a clear Trail to him or something so who knows now have did you come across any has there been any paranormal investigators that have gone there or any like psychic mediums that have gone there I'm not sure the the lodge the main Lodge has rumored to be very haunted numerous ghost sightings of of children and people in old timey Garb but I don't know if there have been any type of paranormal investigations done maybe we could be the first oh let there's also Bigfoot has been cited here I love Bigfoot I know you do I am one of those people I love Bigfoot he's out there yes and apparently he's been at Crater Lake Oregon has the most sightings of Bigfoot than any other state in the country and many of those sightings are at Crater Lake Rangers once reported so these are official Rangers that work there reported following a large dark putrid smelling hairy creature through the woods and they were trying to track it until it started violently throwing pine cones at them when they and so they had to retreat and then they couldn't find it anymore that sounds like my buddy Sasquatch right there's even reports that two Bigfoot bodies have been um found dead bigfoots one from a car accident and one I wasn't sure how it died but supposedly yeah supposedly right after that happened Men In Black type people swooped in and and took them away and they disappeared it and then it was never heard of again just to go back to our previous episode they took Sasquatch to Area 51 well here you go maybe they did because this the Park's also the location of numerous UFO sightings really tons of UFO sightings over it really yes that that kind of pequs my interest because you've got this kind of kind of energetically negative place that there is stuff not only on Surface but in the air above it so aliens aliens perfect match there's even an official report of a pilot February 4th 1997 at 6:15 p.m. a private pilot flying south of Diamond Lake Junction Oregon just which is just east of Crater Lake National Park saw three discs speeding across the sky lit up pursued by several jet interceptors wow wow and a lot of people say that these lights and these discs that they see go in and out of the lake and one of the Legends says that that lake is a portal maybe to another Universe maybe to you know the outer Universe I don't know maybe like I said it is the West Coast Bermuda Triangle now interestingly enough the evening that that pilot said that he saw those um those discs flying that were chased by Jets there's also reports of a sonic boom so massive that it set off car alarms all over the area that same night is this kind of in a more remote area of Oregon it is up in the Cascade Mountains so it's kind of hard to get to you know you have to kind of get out there to it there are campgrounds and things out there it again a national park great place to go I'm putting my money on Portal this is a portal yeah there's been murders there a couple people were murdered there like execution style GM Big Wigs [ __ ] what do they call them Executives like Executives from United Motor Service which subsidary of GM General Motors they were oh wow they had their hands tied behind their back gagged and then LED off the side of the road into the brush and were shot in the back of the head execution style and nobody knows why that was just a normal Tuesday in downtown Boston in the 80s yeah so this place is you know pretty spooky beautiful the water's so blue there's a one of the nicer Legends is that the the bluebird used to be gray until it swam into the Waters of Crater Lake and because the waters themselves are so beautifully blue so this gray bird flew into the lake and when it flew out it was it's the blue bird that you see today I like that that's like the only nice thing I found but I'm telling you I you know I'm gonna put my money on it's a portal I no longer think it's the portal to hell or a demon portal I am going with this is an alien portal Lake yeah we've got it all that's where my money's going place is the sight of weird unnatural deaths murders Sasquatch aliens ghosts everything it's got it all demons sign me up I want to go so beautiful but deadly let's put this under you know beautiful but [ __ ] deadly you know it it actually kind of I I do laugh a little bit on the inside that it's got such this negative history and and and almost kind of superstitious air about it but yet it's a national park that people flock to regardless right and people love it yeah so it really does make me want to go to Oregon oh my gosh I wanted to go to Oregon anyways but what have you got for us on the East what are you gonna try to beat me with because how are you gonna creep me out tonight shell this is so easy Leila like so easy I would say this is and and and and this is just not personal opinion this is actually other people's opinion as well one of the most uh haunted locations in the United States really now a lot of places have have tried to say they have that cleaned Fame right and and if you recall on my last episode I said something very similar about Gettysburg it's true that's very true episode eight go check it out this is the the we're going back to another Asylum and oh you know I hate those you know those totally creep me out wor they are creepy to begin with just the man's inhumanity to man I mean simply going by that asylums are [ __ ] awful well this is probably the most famous uh Lunatic Asylum um in the country and it was probably the biggest at the time this is the trans alany Lunatic Asylum located in West Virginia oh God all right all right all right I'm already creeped out I'm already creeped out okay hold on I'm gonna let me get some candy oh my god do you have a seiz candy out there no it's this candy joint oh my God my mother-in-law again shout out to my mother-in-law love that joint hope you have fun for my birth for my birthday still my birthday

so freaking amazing I have to go get more so good I love candy can't go wrong with candy too much dark chocolate lately I have been pigging out but I might need to get more of this dark California BR this is so good all right all right so hold on I got some chocolate I got my bowl packed all right I need I need my blankie you're gonna need your blankie for this one I know okay all right go ahead and SC all right I'm ready scare me so Not only was the the considered probably the most haunted place in West Virginia but again very famous very large very haunted asylum in America this actually was constructed in the early 1800s they stopped construction though in 1858 because this was actually used uh during the Civil War similar to my my last episode about Gettysburg Civil War sticking with that Civil War theme you know as we talked about last time with with Gettysburg in the Civil War a lot of these people that that were a part of the Civil War were very young um might not have known what they had quote unquote signed themselves up for yeah so many kids and young adults damn and died in horrific ways yeah yeah war is [ __ ] hell people yeah yeah so at the time the place was known as the Weston State Hospital uh when it was first constructed the reason they had to stop Construction in 1858 was due to the Union Soldiers wanting to use the land as so one of those things the military is coming through and they're like hey we need to comeand Deere this to use it for the military right now pretty much okay pretty much but the man who created the building Thomas story Kirk bird Kirk bird or Kirk birdie that's that's a great Kirk Bird that's a great name Thomas story Kirk bird bird I love the name story I think that's a fabulous name that would be a great middle name actually right he was actually a mentally ill man go figure the irony a mentally ill man who wanted to be Associated uh with an American Psychiatric facility why wait a minute is this like some sort of Club people want to join I want to be part of the okay maybe credential here or something was he the practicing psychiatrist or something no he was mentally ill right sorry okay so this mentally ill guy for some reason wants to be associated with okay all right whatever but he created the building all right so during it you know during its Heyday it was filled with all kinds of different mentally ill patients but this Kirk bird guy Kirk bird he believed that he had such a weird business model he believed that the patients should be allowed to roam the facility at Free Will Wait a minute so wait so just because this guy designed the facility they're GNA let him come up with any [ __ ] up rule he can think of and they're gonna be like well he paid for it so okay dude this was like the 1800s I take it back I don't like the name story anymore 1800s what are you expecting here just call him [ __ ] bird so anyway he had the brilliant idea to let the patients just roam which you know hey better than being locked in a room can't blame them he he believed that letting them roam would help them be cured of their mental illness what the [ __ ] that makes zero okay wait all right so [ __ ] bird says let them run free and they'll get better whatever all right I need to smoke way more weed for that to make sense catchup shell catchup got to smoke way more for that to make sense that's right basically it was built to contain 250 people but they were each supposed to have like their own room so it was kind of built to accommodate 250 people that were supposed to have their their own comfortable room well that that sounds kind of nice I guess that could be I guess you know I'm being negative that could be nice in theory in theory though you know with a lunatic asylum this shit's only in theory and like going to go downhill quick right I mean if you got some of these some of these people are so mentally ill and some of them are violent and some of them really should not be roaming free but according to Kirk bird it was gonna cure so in 1863 there was tragedy at the hospital because due to oh big surprise surprise you're putting Psychopathic murderer people roaming free with your average you know Al olc housewife and some kid that was born to a [ __ ] that has no nowhere else to go I mean really but that was also at a point you know you also got to figure 1863 you know we're in the midst of the Civil War A1 steak sauce was created what the [ __ ] this is the type to you to remember a food Associated thing y it was a civil war A1 steak sauce is there a correlation here was it created by [ __ ] bird in the Asylum no it was just solid like just a food thing that's okay it's is just a shell thing all right I love A1 steak sauce myself when you smoke a lot of marijuana over an extended many years you start to learn fun interesting useless facts random facts stick in your brain well I love that one I'm never going to forget it now Civil War A1 steak sauce was created during the Civil War I did not know that and it it's actually kind of an interesting fact you know we're in the middle of the Civil War and the first thing they're coming up with is damn we need a good steak sauce well you have to have your priorities straight I guess but also besides A1 steak sauce which I love besides that excellent Factor CH but with the civil war going on as you can imagine um there was a lot more there was an increase in mental health diagnosises yeah no [ __ ] you know your your 18 years old and your husband goes out for the afternoon and comes back with half his arm no leg that was a rough time the Civil War was a pretty shitty game and he was fighting you know the other half of your family right right so they took this over it's more like a hospital hospital and it was actually so I said built for about 250 people to have their own comfortable room it was now overrun with 500 patients with different types of problems not just mental illness and they could hardly even keep up with the patients so for something that was essentially tagged for 250 people to all of a sudden have double occupancy 500 people as you can imagine conditions deteriorated real quick you know they they everybody was crammed together they were starting to have four or five people in a room that was meant for one person and by 1938 this is how shitty our government is and has always has been by 1938 the Asylum was six times over capacity what the hell these are single rooms how the [ __ ] are sing six oh my gosh the conditions there must have been horrific dirty and infected and oh gross then keep in mind you know nobody's shut in the room you're all just roaming the Halls all crazy that place is haunted haunted the patients started running wild out of control there wasn't even any room to keep anybody anymore food supply was running low and and you know we're talking septic as hell yeah yeah I mean if you weren't crazy you were probably getting like staff infection I don't know but you're not being attacked by some of the more violent inmates you want to hear something crazy at at the peak of the 1950s the hospital had 2600 patients wow it was built for 2 times they were sleeping on the floor and freezing rooms with no furniture or heat the windows were covered and grime and mold wallpaper peeling and decayed oh that's awful that's awful oh my gosh that sounds oh and you know what started and and you know what started in America here this was the birthplace of experimental labotomy oh no oh no they had performed over 4,000 labotomy what 4000 4,000 what ew ew ew e no that's the thing where they stick a pickup in your no no up in your eye no uh up your nose in punctu no no no and this left some of the healthy patients with brain damage and hemorrhaging oh my gosh they would do did they do that just like to keep people quiet sometimes oh go can I can I can I tell you something what they use what was called the quote unquote ice pick method and it involves slipping a thin pointed Rod like an ice pick into into the patient's eye socket and us a hammer to force it to sever the connective tissue in the frontal brain no no no no ew ew ew ew ew e no mm mm no I need a mental break hold on yeah yeah pass me that bong no shell no no yeah and you want to know horrible that's horrible was it this place did not close until 1994 what what what this place did not close until 1994 you're [ __ ] me you are [ __ ] me yeah they obviously weren't doing lobotomies but they tell me they weren't doing lobotomies like that in N that I don't know that I don't know and the only part they ever expanded from the original um build was a graveyard and since 2007 the owners decided to do day tours and paranormal tours and ghost tours so this is actually a place now well before I get into that they actually believe that there are still about seven or eight specific ghosties that are still there only seven or eight yeah that they can distinguish and kind of quote unquote put a name to Legend says that you can hear uh one of the patients commonly associated with a girl named Lily um she was one of the patients from the Civil War era that died from pneumonia at the age of nine and there has been witnesses that say that if you step into her playroom you can sometimes either hear her crying or hear her laughing well that sounds creepy where's her playroom there was a room one of the rooms yeah yeah yeah what does it mean if she's crying or laughing oh [ __ ] that sounds creepy kid ghosts are creepy that also gives you kind of a picture that you know you know mentally ill used as a hospital but the age range of the patients was from small children to to aged adults well yeah I know from some of our other um Asylum talks and investigations they pretty much would throw anybody in there it wasn't just people who had mental illness it was people who were depressed or who were elderly people who alcoholics or were poor people orphans malform you know people who had some type of physical ailment you know you could be in an asylum for all sorts of reasons none of which had anything to do with illness or Your Capacity to take care of yourself but if you were to look at a picture of this place Lea you would think that it was like an a manor house but it it really was more like a house of horrors yeah it sounds like it nice on the outside but absolutely rotten to the core right right because again you know you got all that that sadness and death and and disease stting right from the Civil War era you know they're they nowadays they they do tours they do paranormal things there and they've actually talked about that there's a man they don't know who the man is but they see him frequently and he will actually lay his hand on your shoulder and squeeze what no he touches people he will lay his hand on yeah why is he touching people hey boundaries here Mr ghost no shoulder touching no touchy touchy why is he touching people I don't know maybe he's a curve I don't know go ask that's all he does he puts his hand on people's shoulder and that's it it kind of gives you gives you that little squeeze of I'm here even though there's oh wow oh wow oh creepy yeah you know they they have heard people screaming in the medical rooms which is where at the time the labotomy would have been help you can screams they know the where the labotomy rooms are yeah actually this is I we got to add this to the list you can actually go there they do overnight um tours they're generally eight hours long you go in at 900 PM you come out at 5 a.m. um you are in the Asylum overnight they've done shows there actually like Ghost Hunters and they've all been there we should go I would love to go to all these places with you shelle this would be so oh would be a dream come true you know what is interesting about what I have found in my research about trans alagan Asylum you know some of the other asylums we've talked about there has been quote unquote Spirit activity of Staff the nurse that never left the doctor that never left kind of thing right there are no accounts that I have been able to come across of Staff haunting it it seems to focus 100% on patient hunting they got the [ __ ] out even in death they're like I'm not staying here this place is being run by the patients I'm out well one of the myths was was that when it actually closed down all of the staff went into the chapel area and kind of did a religious ceremony to cut ties with the asy smart oh wow that's actually really smart I mean we talked about when we go to uh the RMS Queen Mary saging ourselves down some incense right totally cleansing ourselves it's a smart thing so yeah they actually held a religious ceremony to kind of end their time I think probably in their mind it was more we did a lot of shitty things and we want to kind of confess our sins to our maker kind of idea but I think that what they actually did was they kind of severed their spiritual ties with the joint and that is kind of well I would hope that they asked for forgiveness too if they did any of those horrendous things to people at least in some way you need to atone for that that's terrible I mean there has been sightings like it it almost was like things were left there you can go there there's wheelchairs there there's still toys there filing cabinets um there's still phones on the desk the old like rotary phones oh wow super creepy so there have been reports that all of a sudden wheelchair will just be like rolling down the hallway on its own dang you'll go into one of the playrooms and you'll be in there by yourself and all of a sudden the ball will just start rolling across the floor to the other side of the room so it's not that they can necessarily say that you know patient XYZ just rolled that ball across the room right you know things happen right right you know they can they can kind of pinpoint Lily just because of of some certain details but other than that they can't really kind of tie a lot of the activity to specific patients per se but you know it's not just apparitions it is the you know you're feeling like you've been touched and grabbed and physical objects are now moving you know you're hearing audio things so there's the gamut of of Paranormal Activity here and the thought of being able to just go pay a hundred bucks and stay there from 9 o'clock at night till 5 o'clock in the morning is so appealing to me it does sound like a lot of fun I'd be there I'd go with you sh I'll go just is po legal there can I bring my stash I don't know about West Virginia if any of our listeners are from West Virginia can you please let us know if marijuana is legal in your state Google would know give me some uh give me some hold music normal lead legal West Virginia no it is not legal bummer medical marijuana is legal for registered patients but they're still in the process and adult use recreational Cannabis is not legal in the state of West Virginia I have a 4C [ __ ] about medical marijuana my 4 second [ __ ] how come my medical card doesn't work state to state and only in the state issued Federal because it's right now it's state by state mandated there is no federal broad like marriages are federally recognized so any state you get married in and plus States anyway it's probably a bad analogy but you know it's not there is no Coalition of states that said we promise to recognize what other states do and there is no federal legalization as of yet so there's no blanket protection across yeah they could do it would take a minute I mean what the hell anyway we're not going there different podcast different podcasts so transal Asylum sounds creepy super creepy when you combined the Civil War era traumas and and Horrors that we know of that time frame combined with you know this is where they they were doing experimental lobotomies and thousands of them you can imagine that there again you know kind of like Gettysburg there's some sad people here and because a lot of these people are mentally ill they don't know they're dead yet they almost feel like they're still living there you know they're they're playing ball in the playroom and you know shuffle in their wheelchair down the hallway but this is again this is supposed to be pretty much the most haunted asylum in America and I believe it is the only one that you can actually do overnight um tours out I don't know sh I have to say I think looking at both of our stories this evening mine National Park Campground gorgeous Lake I'm saying let's go let's tell some stories around the campfire it sounds like a great spooky time just don't look at the water yours is [ __ ] creepy yeah I'm downright scared I think you win this evening I would have to say yours sounds way spookier if I just again I'm just saying if we were to camp at Crater Lake fun Spooktacular evening if we were to go do an overnight at the asylum totally [ __ ] scared so yeah you definitely win but at Crater Lake here here's why I would actually think that maybe you win tonight because at Crater Lake hey we're camping and who doesn't love camping yeah there's a win right there different kind of win but still a win right but we could see Bigfoot or aliens right there is okay that's true point is a lot there I could see ghosts any old time okay no off those ghosts are so creepy oh my gosh little girl laughing Toys stuff moving on its own so freaking creepy the botomy people screaming Bigfoot spip going into the lake yeah gateway to Hell don't look at the water would you look at the water like how can you not I would and I would be like I can't I can't my God scar I can't I can't I would probably like not stare directly into it you know I'd make up rules I didn't kind of glance at the water but I just won't stare deep into its eye or something well Ila between you and I we'll call it a draw because I'm intrigued so much by yours you're intrigued so much by mine but if any of our listeners have a preference who wins tonight East
