welcome to back on the broomstick where magic mystery and love are always in the air in this episode we're going to cast a spell of love as we delve into the world of love magic Love Is in the Air from the basics of spellcasting to the dos and don'ts of working with the energies of love and all things a more whether you're looking to attract a new love or reignite the spark in an existing relationship we've got you covered this episode so grab your rose petals light some candles and let's cast a spell of love with back on the broomstick I'm Lea and joining me is my co-host shell I am totally in the mood for love with this episode me too shelle let's Dive Right In like I have a great right invocation I'm gonna read the great right which is a Wiccan concept right this is the wiccan concept of hyros gamos sacred masculine sacred feminine it's the sacred wedding basically you symbolically wed the male energy with the female energy you call the god you call the goddess talking about symbolic no yeah no you can yeah I know you can do it symbolically you know that's staying in right so representative of this act of sex of regeneration of life you have the aame or the wand or the the dagger that represents a phus that represents a penis looks like a penis like penis and talks like penis it represents penis and then you have a chalice or a cup or a goblet the vessel that represents femininity that represents the womb that represents the vagina and so you symbolically put these two together with great words now it doesn't sound fun or sexy or beautiful at all it just sounds scientific and weird so go ahead and give us the what's the great right okay now generally speaking the the the male and the female would speak these lines together and the female would actually be holding the ath and the male would be holding the Chalice just real quick I just want to say for female and male that you're talking about wian like traditional Wiccan they literally wanted a woman to initiate a man man woman that was pretty much it whereas in general paganism and specifically in our practice and in the the groups the coven in the greater groups that we whatever works for you it's whatever works for you so when she says female in male she's just referencing stri Wick yeah and she's referencing like different types of energy and the the yin the Yang the positive the negative the the giving the receiving you know there's different ways you can say that here it's female and male but in our tradition many times when each part has been played by people of whatever they identify as we've actually we've actually done it where one person did both and personified both Energies exactly exactly we roll with what we got and I I do find this and the reason I wanted to read this not only because it was in my OG Book of Shadows but because I I do find some great symbolism with this man is not greater than a woman nor is woman greater than man for what one lacks the other May provide as the AEM is to the man so the cup is to the woman and when they are conjoined they become one in Truth for there is no greater magic in all of the worlds than that of love I love that part and I love that there is no greater Magics in all the world than that Happy Valentine's Day everybody Happy Valentine's Day Happy Spring I mean we just had imul Oar on the way like oar is like it's that tick is coming yep it's it is that spring time of year everybody is Twitter pated things are starting to grow flowers are starting to up and people's thoughts turn turn to romance here in the Northeast it's like 50 60° so people are just sprouting the birds are already starting to nest and like it's still February we've got some strange weather up here and it's making people jumpy and perky and all full of love yeah and so today in our episode we'll be talking about love spells and all things romance should you do a love spell shouldn't you do a love spell what's right what's wrong what should I do can I just start out with a person opinion here please sh what do you think this is an important personal opinion okay you be careful with this love magic okay because like if you ever want to see something go arai quick cast a love spell on someone do love magic because that will go aride quick and also there is such a thing as you got wants and you got needs people but there's also something called don't do something against another person's Free Will such as force them to have feelings that they don't have absolutely if you want something to go bad double quick like shell said cast a love spell on someone in the movie The Craft when that came out in the 90s I believe in the late 90s one of the characters in that movie does a love spell on someone and I was thrilled when I saw this depiction because that's exactly how it should go you cast a love spell on a specific person and you're basically Tak away their agency and there's no way a person can bind someone perfectly you're going to word it wrong you're going to word it too strongly as soon as you start messing with someone's Free Will you're going to it up and just don't do itad new bad news and the way I look at love spells and love magic and all of that is you just want to enhance something that's already there but the minute you start trying to create something that isn't there  it's it's going to backfire it's going to turn out bad and you are going to get karma like nobody's business I love love I love love spells but this is something you got to be careful with and interestingly with love spells it seems to happen when we talk about karmic retribution when you put energy out there into the world whatever it is if you're going to say something to someone you're putting energy into the world there will be repercussions and reactions to that and so when you're doing a spell it's the exact same thing you are putting your intentions and desires and energy out into the world and something will happen and that will come back to you and so it seems to me anytime I've seen anyone do a a love spell that's negative or positive the results tend to be relatively quick from what I've seen I mean there are the love spells I have heard of a few people that have done love spells from the time they were children again I'm going to reference a movie this time Practical Magic where she wishes for what she says is The Impossible Man and she creates all these impossible little things that she adds into her spell and eventually she finds that exact impossible man and falls in love with him and so some people will do longer lasting spells like that but the Karma's going to come quick people you know you the person's going to be obsessed with you and they won't stop calling you know you're going to fall out of love with them and they will continue to fall further and further in love with you so just don't do it on a specific person but instead there's a lot of things we can do we've all done love spells you've done love spells I've done love spells but it's what you do and how you do it and maybe calling love into your life calling love into your heart that's you know that's that's different than a Target don't Target people oh I like what you said calling love into your life and and saying I am ready for love I am ready for a relationship that will enhance my life for a relationship that will be for the best of me and for the best of them that's a perfect thing to do you can call on the qualities that you want in a lover and in a relationship but just don't pin those specifically to a person and you know that's also something that you know a lot of people are doing self-care and and and self love you can't force yourself to love yourself either so you can't be doing all kinds of forcing love within yourself for yourself as well because that will equally backfire and I've seen a lot of that you know you watch all this stuff on Tik Tok and in Facebook people are doing these spells to kind of fall in love with themselves you know folks that have had inner demons don't like themselves a spell of Love on yourself can backfire just as a spell of Love on Joe Smith down the street you can't make somebody love you and you can't make yourself love yourself either so I think that's a an important fact to kind of put in there so we've said a lot of what you can't do and what you shouldn't do but couple things that are good to do particularly when you're talking about self-love or a specific person yourself- included is what I like to call psychic flirting do tell so I never say I'm going to make this specific person fall in love with me but say I have a specific person in mind shell I want to do a psychic flirting spell with you so what I will do in this spell is I will gather things similar to a love spell rose quartz some cinnamon honey catnip you know all things that are are conducive to a love spell and then in the wording of the spell instead of saying I'm going to make shell fall in love with me I will say this spell is to create situations where shell and I can get to know each other better this spell is going to create peace of mind when shell and I are together so that we can really open up to each other this spell is designed to enhance connections that are already there and to smooth the way to Healing damage that's there you know word it in such a way to create positive space for relationship to move forward rather than saying this person will love me I want to create situations conducive to us getting closer I actually love that train of thought creating positive space you're not creating an emotion you're creating a space for that emotion to potentially flourish so I like that phrase creating a positive space yeah and I I the other thing with psychic flirting that I like to do is is borrow a little bit from wiah in that in a lot of our older spells we would do um and at harm none do as you will or for the good of all and to harm none which are Garian you know terms from that we pulled right from wiah but those are beautiful to use in a love spell whether for yourself or someone else because you want this to be for your higher good and for their higher good so if this spell is for the good of all may it work is is something definitely that you should put into any romantic spell workings but I think the one thing that we want to definitely touch on is if you are doing these workings what do you use you know you talked about rose quartz I'm a fan of trying to get as many rose petals into any spell workings for love oils Rose oils I actually like anything fruity works for me even lemon lemon oils and stuff um I like orange oil for love too it's a weird thing it's a me thing probably isn't a correspondent but no I think orange is especially orange blossoms or or things like that it's definitely helps with any type of love spell and I believe that that Citrus in a lot of ways personally I feel enhances the energy of any spell but as far as oils go when it comes to a love spell instead of using like your traditional oils that you might find I like to use perfume if I can find a men's perfume like if I'm looking for a man I'm going to go smell like all the perfumes and find the one that I think is the sexiest and has the scent that I want in a partner and I'll use that oil I'll use that perfume hey if I can't buy the whole thing I spray it on those little cards and I take it home you want to hear some crazy kitchen witch that you just reminded me of and I'm I'm laughing to myself I can't even contain myself I remember one time and this was back when I had that gorgeous third floor apartment with that big ritual room I was doing some sort of love spell which I don't recall the contents of the spell itself but I remember I always like to use the herbs and the oils it's my thing and I remember I couldn't come up with the perfect oil and I ended up using KY Lube love that did you have like the best relationship with the most sex ever after that for that particular spell that's you know it was appropriate so you kind of just kitchen witch it sometimes and use whatever you got on here now now for all you little witchlings and baby witches out there when shell and I talk about kitchen witchery we're not talking about cooking we're talking about what used to be the opposite of high magic majy was kitchen witchery whatever you got use thr it all in and I think using Lube is your oil in a romance spell top tier witchcraft right there but you know it worked it worked there's a lot of things that will work you can use scents that you like I love catnip catnip and honey are fabulous like the perfume idea too I never thought of that you know here here my mind goes right to lube and you're like oh perfume yes I like a perfume for myself pick a scent for myself that makes me feel very sensual feel very romantic that makes me feel like I'm Ready For Love or romance and then pick a corresponding scent for my partner or what I'm looking for in a lover and have that be the scent that really arouses me attracts me and hopefully will open up those Pathways to bring that love into my life simple easy spells take a pink or red candle I love to take a small Aime or a nail or something that you have charged from your altar and inscribe around your candle the different with a toothpick that works whatever you've got kitchen witch and just inscribe around it any symbols you've come up with hearts love Stars any words references to you know I want them to like sports or I want them to love the outdoors or love reading you know the different things that you'd like the qualities that you'd like to bring and then you rub your perfume and you take your your incense like shell talked about you can take your cinnamon uh catnip and honey whatever you have put together ba is a good one for love spells to draw things into you one thing I I've done in the past easy because you know sometimes you're just looking for quick and easy write out your intentions you know you want a loving honest relationship everybody's caring whatever you know you can write that on a bay leaf and then burn it in the flame of your Pinker red candle oh that's beautiful and you can take the ashes of that bay leaf along with your other incense and oils and then rub it into the markings that you've put on that candle so that you've kind of dressed the whole candle and keep that by your bed and then anytime you light that candle that starts to send that energy out to the universe and you've got all of those things there they usually work pretty quickly these are like probably the fastest the fastest spells ever there are a couple spells that I personally have been involved with one was a spell that someone that we both know did and it was the kind of spell that we say no one should do but yet we were a part of it yeah so this was a spell when I came up with it I called it the shell spell for sex not U shell but s h l l and basically I took a shell the kind that has you know the spiral kind that has the nice little opening that looks very feminine on shell it could be a conch or con shell but some type of shell like a spiral shell that you can put things into and so into that shell we put our herbs for love and romance and sealed it with red wax and tied it with red string she had had a specific person in mind for this spell and put that shell that was sealed with red wax and tied with red string under his bed and it worked they had a crazy intense sexual relationship but it was very short-lived marked by lot of fights and ended very very badly did it work yes did it end in domestic violence yes did you do something like that no no what she could do instead is like shell said write down the qualities you want write down your spell on a piece of paper or on a bay leaf but don't have a specific person in mind qualities yes specific person names no one type of uh love spell that I am very anti you know you know I've I've had people talk about can you come up with a spell to get an ex back I want my ex back and my first reaction is they are your ex for a reason you know if you want to do something to heal some wounds or or or work on some issues great but magic to bring an ex back you need to move on there are millions of people out in the world and this person is your ex for a reason so I just wanted to put that out there that I am very anti- get your ex back magic and you should be too you know and I think that goes along with don't do love spells until you're in a good emotional space talk to your friends because they'll probably know if you're in a good emotional space or not and and definitely after a bad breakup is not a good time to be doing any kind of love spell you should be doing you know heal myself spells involving Ben and Jerry's lots of romcoms and soft blanket it's probably but not how to get my ex back magic because you know always remember they're your exra reason exactly good point sh very good point sometimes when you're a younger witch a baby witch you kind of get caught up in some of that and you know everybody wants to be loved it's it happens I have myself been caught up in that I remember a time or two begging you to help me with love spells and you just be like good luck figure it out and you know in the end whatever 10 15 years later who was right you credit where credits doe but you know in the moment when you're desperate they seem like the right thing to do and in the end you are hurting yourself and you are hurting someone else and if you're lucky you're only hurting yourself and someone else Mo emotionally and in the most extreme case like you just gave an example of you know domestic violence no good no good not worth it that's not the kind of love you want that's not the kind of love that you're trying to project and I think most people when they're looking for a love spell usually aren't in the best frame of mind when we're seeking out a love spell like you said we're usually we're desperate for that love or we've been in a relationship that ended and we know if we just make them see we could make it different or make it better and so we're reaching for that love spell to try and smooth things over make things a little better right now make me feel better right now that's not going to help you know there's more work to it than that and how many times at the end of a relationship have you been crying and upset and you just want them back shell and then a week later you're like oh my goodness right I am so glad this is over holy I'm so glad no one listened to me that day when I was out of my mind upset and sad you know it reminds me of those of that tarot meme you see on on Facebook and Instagram all the time where it's like this person came and asked me about the relationship for the hundredth time and here's what the tarot card said and they position all the cards to say dump him yes I've had to do that a lot of my tarot clients in the past back in my Heyday of doing readings I would have to say a good 75 80% of every single reading was a love question and 100% of the people who came back to me more than three times in a one-year period period were love questions I think unfortunately there's a certain percentage of folks out there that are trying to draw people into tarot and draw people into Witchcraft and paganism and using love spells and love Tarot readings things of that nature because it is something that by human nature we're desperate for yeah go on Instagram go on Tik Tok and there are people offering them for sale left and right those are the things and readings that people want I don't think they're bad but you got to be careful yeah be careful make sure that you're in good head space for it make sure that you're in a good space in your life the most successful love spell I ever did was a Letting Go spell at s because I was ready to let go of old connections and old things that didn't serve me that following spring the next belain I met the love of my life an absolutely amazing man and I did do a love spell on him but it was more the spell of of if this is right help us work through any obstacles if this is right and true help it to work out it wasn't a manipulation of sorts right again it was more of that psychic flirting and more of a way of clearing the path you know if this is good for both of us help us move through any obstacles if this is good for both of us help us to find you know peace and Truth and Love in each other and it really worked out beautifully we're still together it's been 23 plus years so I'd say it probably worked pretty success but you weren't trying to sway his personal emotions and that's the key and I think that that's where where people go wrong and even in Practical Magic you know it was the neighbor lady remember the neighbor lady she's like I just want him to love me you know I I think that desperateness is it it clouds people's vision and if you are going to do any sort of love spell the less clouded you are the better it's going to work out you can't doing this kind of thing when you're in that desperate mode right if your emotions are running hot that is the last time you should be doing a love spell you should be in good mental space good grounded space even like shell said for a love spell for yourself because you can't force yourself to love yourself but you can give yourself peace and you can do a spell to help yourself move through any issues that you have and to work through any negative associations with love and with yourself that you have and so by giving yourself that peace and giving yourself that magical energy great things can happen and you can find true love for yourself or outside yourself I actually have a little spell I want to read to you this is again from back in our Heyday and this spell is called to purify your emotions oh okay I gather these elements to cleanse any toxicity that may cloud my ability to be in the flow of this cycle I clear my own air I release negativity in my fire and I purify my own water I release blockages in my Earth and I ask that this release be gentle and I affirm my trust and faith in my own abundant flow you know you can use that to purify your energy before a love spell before going to work in the morning whatever but I came across that this morning when I was coming up with stuff for us to talk about and I was like you know that that's a good one to put out there because purifying your emotions before doing a love spell like what the hell that's like the greatest idea ever because then you're not clouded and you're not you're not in a desperate emotional state you're you're more even you're more you're more grounded going into it exactly and if you can get yourself into that state then finding the magical flow is so much easier and and being able to align yourself with that energy of of love for the greatest good comes much much easier so I love that being in the right frame of mind you have to be I mean you can't create something great if you're not in a great frame of mind to begin with and isn't that really why you're doing the love spell to begin with is to do something and create something great absolutely something wonderful in your life something amazing have you ever done a Honey Jar spell honey I love honey in particular for love spells honey is just great all the way around I like honey in a honey spell because you got this lick it off you thing you got the sweetness thing like there's so many places you can take it I've actually never done one oh okay I've read about them I've seen a bunch of them on Tik Tok but I've actually never done one um I do get the concept where you're kind of you know just like this honey is sweet my love will be sweet concept it's also the idea of Honey being sticky and so it will ENT trap you know it's a sweet trap you catch more flies with honey kind of thing no aren't you aren't you supposed to put the name of of the person you're pining for on a bay leaf and stick the bay leaf in the honey is that really kind of the concept of a Honey Jar that is a concept of a Honey Jar probably one of the more original Concepts but again don't put someone's specific name on the bay leaf just put the qualities that you want to attract on the bay leaf and put that in the Honey Jar now when you have done it what did you did you do do something different what what did you do CU again I've never done it I've just read about you know write something on your Leaf stick your Leaf in so a Honey Jar is basically it's a magical jar using honey you can do pretty much anything you want to the Honey Jar that I did is uh very similar to Shell spell jars that we've spoken about before you just take a very small jar take your honey and you can take any other items that you want in it as well some people will you take a bay leaf is traditional and you can put a rose quartz in there rose petals you can put hematite or tiger's eye you know if you want to remove blockages you can use the the hematite to try to if you have blockages For Love or tiger's eye if you want to bring that type of energy in but just like a spell jar put your honey in put your chips of rose quartz put in some rose petals whatever love associations you have maybe a drop or two of the perfume and then write the qualities that you want on that bay leaf and then put it in the jar you can then seal it take that jar and put it under your pillow put it under your bed put it next to your bed uh there's a lot of traditional things that you can do with it you can bury it outside what type of Honey Jar did you find um I you know I kind of like the in in the spirit of my little spell jars that I've been totally digging for the last several months I would want to actually wax seal it I would think that wax sealing it with some red wax and maybe giving it an imprint of some sort of Love sigil into that wax might also be a a nice little added potent kick at the end I'm all for pretty so I would probably put some like red ribbon around the top as well I don't like to bury things and I think it's kind of the I don't want to kill the Earth in me so I'm not a big fan of Barry and things so I would make it pretty so that it could be under a bed or next to a bed or something of that nature the purpose of sealing it with the wax is is hopefully it's a candle that you've used in your ritual and you take the wax and you seal the stopper of the jar and the purpose of that is to seal all that energy that you've created during your spell and creating the jar in the jar so you seal it with the wax and then you take your Ribbon or your red string and notot Magic is another way to hold on to energy so you tie knots into this string as you're thinking of the things that you want to find to you self-love uh positive energy positive affirmations the things that you want to bring into you tie your knots in the string and then you tie that string around the sealed bottle again the act of tying is an act of binding and binding those energies and sealing them into the jar to keep it potent and then like shell said instead of burying it keep it next to your bed or keep it in your kitchen or by your front door so that every time you see it it reawakens that magic it rekindles that energy and reignites the spell out in the world to kind of bring that love to you or whatever it is um that you've put in the jar um I've also seen where people have Incorporated drinking tea with their Honey Jar spell um and they will actually put some of the honey in the tea let it kind of ferment at the bottom sip the tea off the top of it and then use that remaining honey in the Honey Jar and I guess the concept is is is I drink this honey you're going to be delicious you will be as delicious as my tea tea one of my favorite teas is rose hips any tea that has like rose hips cranberries orange blossoms that type of thing or orange peels in it I love it tastes fabulous and rose hips are definitely part of any love spell yeah you know they're fantastic so orange blossoms and orange smell is also something else that people associate with that kind of fresh new Love and romance I thought that was just a me thing with the whole orange thing you know you can put your herbs in your tea to have meaning you know a little bit of mint and things like that to kind of bring that energy into you and then honey is beautiful for a love spell like shell said it's perfect for licking off someone it's sweet you know it has all these wonderful qualities to bring someone to you and then make it stick so it I think a tea ceremony is a great way to do a love spell well because I do like tea it's an easy way to kind of throw tea into everything yeah and I think you know I think that just for the sake of touching on it because of of the relevancy there is also a whole different set of love spell type things that are more centered around sex there is Sex Magic there is there is spells to enhance that attraction again you know you just want to be careful with any type of workings that you're doing that incorporate other people's feelings and emotions and Free Will and it harm none do as you will I know that I don't technically believe all of those but that's a good thing to put into in this particular subject we need to and if you wouldn't do it in real life don't do it in your spell if you wouldn't walk up to someone and grab them by the genitals don't do it in your spell wow that was pretty graphic right but don't do it you know so just keep your spells more and now I forgot what we were saying I got distracted by GS keep keep your spells more in line with what you want your karma to be o I like how you said that yes because you know sometimes we all are willing to sacrifice a little Karma you know keep your spells in line with what you're willing to have your karma be because you get what you put out if anyone is sex positive I would have to say pagans are hugely sex positive and very very happy with it but we still are all about consent you know you should ask first you should make sure that they're interested as well keep asking as you go along always make sure there's consent but we're getting a little long now so we're going to cut it off here but obviously we should have one of our topics be sacred sexuality we'll have to save that for a closer to belain topic that's right we'll talk about a little bit of sacred sexuality and Sex Magic once we get a little closer to belain so be careful with your love spells remember keep your intentions good and pure and we'll chat again next time yep love yourself do a little psychic flirting and see what happens May the Honey work for you I don't know may all your spells be honey sweet so have a great time with your spells practice responsible love spelling and we'll see you next time on back on the broomstick
