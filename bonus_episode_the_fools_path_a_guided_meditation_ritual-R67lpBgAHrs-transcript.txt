the path of the wise and trying out all the latest sells rituals and magical theory in today's Witchcraft and Pagan practices so grab your collagen and your crystals and join us as we get back on the broomstick  hi and welcome to a special meditation episode of back on the broomstick I'm Layla and we're sharing with you the DAT calls and meditation from our recent workshop at Sacred Space the Fool's path unlocking potential and possibility and I Michelle and we're going to share with you the invitations as well as the meditation that Leila and I did at the Sacred Space conference in Towson Maryland because we thought that this was something that we didn't want to just share with the participants at Sacred Space we wanted to share this with all of our listeners as well this meditation is basically the Fool's Journey it's the Fool's Journey as a representation of your life it's basically a symbolic Journey from beginning to end and that can be your life that can be a new job that can be an undertaking it can be anything it could be just because you feel like a fool get you exactly because we all feel like we're starting over sometimes and sometimes you need to get in touch with aloe  is that wisdom may be from yourself on a further part of that spiral or yourself from a past curve of that spiral or maybe from the fool who controls the spiral herself and you need a little bit of that wisdom so this meditation is to help you get in touch with that part of yourself that is basically the omniscient fool the all-knowing All-Seeing part of you that knows the beginning and the ending of your story and can give you a little bit of advice as to where you're at right now on that spiral and you know I kind of looked at this also is like like a reset meditation you know we all get to different points in life where there's a little reset and this kind of came you know us formulating this and presenting this kind of came at a beginning of a reset for me and I did look at it as like a I'm the fool starting over in this is my journey here we go  you could even said that walking that Kendall has spiral was like deeply meaningful for you know there's just something about spirals honestly that kind of get me into that going within whether it's you know in my mind or or gaining deeper knowledge or or whatever it may be but that kind of you know down that rabbit hole of whatever that end is for you spirals are liminal spaces to me they seem very inherently feminine and magical and like you said they can help pull you down into that Alpha state or bring you back out of it and it's all about walking that path of life that spiral path we mentioned before that life is not really a straight lines it's more of a spiral and so you're walking that liminal space to get better in touch or like you said to have a reset to find that spot where you can begin again interesting Lee enough you're talking about walking paths let's touch real quick on  we picked the deities for this meditation as well based on the fact that they are Journey Walker's you get from one plane to another from one form of existence to another I guess the idea here that they're going to help you get from your mundane life and cross the Hedge and crossed that liminal space to the inner workings of yourself to that spiral of DNA essentially escort on your journey here along the moonlit path basically is needed if needed that's true or guard you and guide you active guide who's a partner he's a passionate companion he's a team member or he can be that father figure that guard that is stirred protector  whatever you happen to need Alan and Karen Munoz will be able to give you on that path because they're so familiar with it seemed like a natural fit for the deities that we chose and the meditation in the in the purpose of the meditation Ellen there were so many synchronicities I'll link this Sacred Space episode but go back and listen to some of the synchronicities Ellen I think really demanded to be part of this ritual main objective with this meditation was a time and and I think going forward anytime that I look back on this meditation and revisit this it's going to be too kind of  a path to help me face challenges and Trust the path that I'm on so I think that for listeners out there who want to utilize this meditation think about the challenges that you're facing and entrusting your inner self and Trust in your guides and I think that if you do that this is definitely a great pass to get you there with your beautiful voice that is such a meditation voice but still having a guide with you but still having a guide still having that companion it's going to to help you along this path and sometimes that companion is future you or passed you it's the knowledge that you have gained maybe in a past life or maybe in a future life or somewhere on that spiral that's never-ending spiral you're going to find some wisdom and you're going to find the strength  are the courage to take that leap of faith and that's what this medication is for and I think when you come out the other side you definitely get that instant perspective of how wow okay I can do this I I I know what I need to do I know where I'm headed I know the path I need to walk and you've got the tools that you need let's do this that's perfect exactly all right well let's get started so the only thing you need for this meditation is a comfortable place and take a look at an image of the fool card either look one up online or grab your favorite full card from you tear that that's all you need over 200 Tarot deck switch full car do I pick or do I use all 200 plus you closed your eyes been around you grab a Jack and you take the fool card out of that one actually that's a fabulous idea now that you say that  only have a couple decks you can pick one of those are you can pick your favorite image online it doesn't have to be a physical. Just take a look at that card and and remember that it's just time to meditate  before we start the meditation we will call in energies deities guys and Guardians to watch over us Ellen of the ways
