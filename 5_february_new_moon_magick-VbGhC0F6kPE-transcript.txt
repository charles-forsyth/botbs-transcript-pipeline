[Music] welcome to episode five of back on the broomstick where two witchy best friends from way back get together to reignite their passion for that witchy way of life join us today as we talk about New Moon manifestation and grounding so join shell and Lila as we get back on the broomstick I'm Leila and I'm shell and boy have we got some good stuff for you today the new moon is on February 20th so that just happened the moon in February is called what is it the hunger moon or the snow moon give me a second nope I think January was snow oh no you know what my bad you are right I should have known better you are a February baby I should have listened to you it is the snow Moon the snow Moon it is now the new snow Moon and I believe that the Moon is in Pisces right now yikes it's all I got to say about that yikes but you know I'm a Gemini so you know know every every astrological sign freaks me out let's see Pisces New Moon that kind of calls for us to surrender to give in to ground our energy and Pisces kind of teaches us that there are no wrong paths and that you know they kind of swim in two different directions you know so Pisces kind of teaches us that there is no wrong path to kind of follow your intuition and follow that call of Destiny for any of our listeners that are are deep into astrology the February New Moon the snow Moon Rises with Jupiter Mars and Orion oh I love Orion it's one of my favorite constellations because it's so easy to pick out in the sky so who doesn't love Orion the easy ones are the best ones right now um actually in New England you're starting to be able to see the Big Dipper again which if you know anything about New England when you're in the Deep Darks of the winter you don't get to see the Big Dipper so when I saw it for the first time a couple nights ago I was like spring is coming Ursa Major Ursa Major being one of those first signs of spring I didn't know that I didn't notice it until I noticed it and then when I looked into it I was like no um all winter long I haven't been able to see the Big Dipper but I have been able to see the little one and then the other night just out of nowhere I was like oh look at that nice you to come back friend I love that spring is springing here in the Northeast because the Big Dipper's back or major let's do this yeah and and with this new moon energy it's all about kind of going within we've talked before about the new moon being a time to go within to formulate your intentions to think about what you want to manifest for that next month and this is the perfect month the February new moon is the perfect time to do that so I I I want to start off real quick on a semi-personal note very new moon February related you know how every week I try to go back um through my book of shadows of of old stuff that we've done throughout our lives together your amazing chronicled Book of Shadows from decades ago that I love listen to this treasure so I'm scrolling through I was like oh you know let me find some good uh New Moon stuff for for this episode and what I came across now granted this was a long time ago but on February 22nd that is when you and another friend of ours at the time did my initiation ritual no way oh my goodness and what's even greater is I actually have the whole ritual word for word I think it's four pages I have four pages of it written out that was actually February 22nd 1997 oh my good Gods I cannot believe how awesome that you still have that I just wanted to bring that up not because it was necessarily relevant to our new Moon episode but because it actually is Rel anniversary aniversary I don't recall it actually looks like when I started writing it down that this was uh February 22nd 1997 full moon so it was like the the the opposite yeah but yeah so I have that whole thing written out and I wanted to point that out because it's it's anniversary time look at that well happy initiation anniversary shell my thank you but I did I did come up with some other tidbits one thing I wanted to just kind of touch on is sometimes people are looking to find deity to work with what deity do I work with for the full moon what deity do I work with for the new moon what deity do I work with for love prosperity in general and so I had actually come across a listing that we had from back in the mid90s of moon deities oh neat okay I wanted to just touch on some of them um I don't want to obviously go into great detail about all of them because we want to talk about some inner work as well but some popular ones Aphrodite people forget Aphrodite is actually a moon goddess as well she is a moon goddess but also you know love of women love beauty Joy of physical love sensuality fertility passion generosity affection but also a moon deity so Aphrodite is someone that you could call into your your full moon or New Moon working Athena another Moon Goddess she is also the goddess of Freedom protection writing music wisdom renewal uh True Justice but also she is a new moon goddess Bast Egyptian goddess of fire love Bast by the way I'm a but she is a the goddess of fire childbirth fertility pleasure Joy she is also a dark moon goddess and then of course if you want to touch on some Gods we've got konos and pan and th so these are not only deity that you can that you can connect with in general um and on a longterm basis but they're also deities that you can you can kind of call into assist in your workings and I just I wanted to kind of round it out with a deity I've worked with for Jesus Lord pushing years you always go right to the Christian swears I I go to the Christian swears as I talk about hkat let's talk about H so you know with hiate the reason I think that she molds so so well into my new moon workings is that looking within doing that shadow work manifesting your desires you know if you want it work for it ain't getting handed to you on a silver platter just real quick do you have any any Moon deities in specific that you gravitate to or a dark moon deity specifically you gravitate to for me no in particular I don't necessarily approach ritual on the new moon or the full moon looking for a particular Moon deity usually when I do ritual if I call in a specific deity I'm generally looking for guidance from that deity or a particular aspect of that deity so rather than look for say a moon goddess on the full moon or the new moon say I'm I'm looking for I'm trying to find my own potential and I'm trying to go within and and and renew my sense of self and find my own potential on that new moon I might call to Green Tara and ask her for those energies so rather than looking for a specific moon or New Moon deity I would look for a deity that aligns with your intentions exactly that aligns with the intentions of the spell or the ritual that I'm doing for that new or full moon maybe with me it's just because I've been with hiate we've been like we've been like thick as thieves for so many decades maybe it's just she's related to the moon but also everything else in my life I don't know I don't know yeah and and I was going to say that is that you know finding a deity or a crystal or an incense that relates to the new moon and to your intention is just another way to add one more layer to your spell or to your ritual if you find a new moon goddess like you talked about Athena and she's very much has to do with wisdom and with Justice say you have a big test coming up you might want to tailor your the intention that you're setting at the new moon which is the best time to set an intention you know she's a moon goddess and she talks about having wisdom she fits all those boxes and so that could make that working that much more powerful because you've kind of checked off more than one box that matches your intention right and I think sometimes that when I'm doing something a little more deep and intentional I am a box Checker offer those are the times where I'm cast in that Circle call in those quarters and calling deity cuz I I do still feel that in my particular practice there's a time and place for that formality definit much so definitely not all the time but there is the occasion where you just want to not to be rude but you just want to kind of rock out with your out and you just want to you want to create that perfect circle and and call in those quarters and call in that deity and and and be formal in the moment and then there's other times where you're just winging this well I think it's like any activity you can kind of get into a state of flow and anything that helps you stay in that state of flow is going to help your magic and help your especially if you're doing any type of manifestation or intention setting you want to be in that perfect state of alignment and so having a like for like you know you you want money so you have money on your altar you have maybe you have gold or you have you know valuable crystals you have beautiful items because that draws in that energy that like for like energy and it's easier when you can have that there in front of you to manifest that on a bigger scale rather than just sitting there and trying to imagine it which can either start from just a wish or if you have built up the skill of putting yourself into that alignment in a meditative space then you can kind of do that on your own as far as intentions what do you think about intention setting on the new moon what's your opinion on that love it I think new moons are the perfect time to set intentions I think that's the time when you kind of do that inner work when you're going to be journaling when you're going to be setting those things that you want to because the new moon is when everything is everything is still there's no light the moon reflects zero light back from the Sun and so this is the time when you go within you go into that dark space and then you start to grow and so whatever you're planting now is what's going to grow as the energy of that Moon lights up with the Sun as that grows so too does your intention grow and so it's I think it's a fabulous time to set intentions and I think that is why when we had Circle amarra our our old coven that we kind of gravitated and did all of our monthly rituals on the new moon as opposed to every other coven that does it on the full moon because we were kind of very much more intention centered manifestation centered and that just kind of vibed more with that Dark Moon energy the full moon is very much about celebrations about the Fulfillment of those intentions that you set and so it lends itself very easily to covens and groups celebrating and getting together on that time and and reveling in the God and the goddess which is wonderful but I think you're right amarat was more about going within we were very much a learning and a teaching coven and we were seeking that knowledge we wanted to you know manifest bring this out into the world and so like you said we gravitate ated towards worshiping together and celebrating our circles and espit on the new moon because of that power that potential whenever you're setting your intentions whether it's for a new moon a full moon or any ritual you want to make sure you are clear and you are concise and you are you are like right to the point like there is no room for oh wow I shouldn't have said that like you need to be concise yeah I agree you know it's like be careful that old saying be careful what you wish for yeah we have been product of that before many a time where maybe we weren't clear and concise enough and we got what we asked for and damn it sure we did that's right so what you know whatever intention you're setting it's a good idea journaling is a great time you know do it before your ritual do a lot of journaling to kind of be clear in what intentions you're setting you know make sure you've set up your ritual your spell ahead of time so you know again the the journaling thing maybe because I'm doing it so much this year but I think that that's really big you know Shell's got all these journals from rituals past and and writing them down beforehand really helps you not only learn it but go over exactly what you're asking for and you know I think we had an easier time of doing that as a group um as opposed to doing that on a solitary level on a solitary level sometimes you just do the ritual and you like you've seen how I've written these rituals down from years ago I mean I've got word for word you know ilila says this and shell says this and so and so says this like I got that plot right out sometimes the motivation to do that gets lost in a solitary life so sure maybe that should be your first new moon intentions to get into that specific journaling because it really is it's a good thing whether it's to help you process things out or like in my book of shadows case stuff that I can go back two years later exactly and and writing out your ritual beforehand and writing out your intention maybe a couple different times can really help you to clarify what you want and what you're asking for and also identify the steps to kind of get it because you can't just you know as we've talked about before you can't just wish for it you have to do the ritual you have to do the work magical and mundane in order to make those things happen absolutely absolutely because you know stuff like I said stuff just doesn't come up on a silver platter for you right as much as we might want it to Magic does help don't get me wrong it's certainly going to help give you an added Edge for sure ironically the new moon and you know people might think this is the exact opposite it is actually the perfect time to start new things for some strange reason can't explain it to you it is actually the most fertile day of the lunar calendar each month I don't well again it's the it's the time of of absolute new beginning anything is possible it's the time when things are right about to start you know it's it's a very magical moment when the moon is new because everything is about to grow from there I mean you can you know apply for a job or you can you know start something you you're passionate about um whatever the case may be take it literally have a baby if that's what you're working at I don't know ask somebody out on a date it's just a good time to start new things and I think the new moon is always gotten a bad rap because dark is evil but we always embraced it as like this beautiful thing particularly this you know in February with this new moon in Pisces it's very much about setting those intentions and having you know having these things come to you it's such a good time to kind of get into one question I have for you I don't know if you can answer this what is the relevance um how does pisces play into this new moon you take take the new moon energy and the Pisces energy and and what makes this new moon different from say the new moon in Aquarius well you know every month is going to kind of have its own Vibe and its own energy each month you know every moon has its own name and its own associations the month that you start something kind of has the same thing you know you want to start new things at the new moon and you want to celebrate culminations at the full moon the different energies of the month are yet more Cycles within a year and so in the Pisces season nariana montufar she's a senior astrologer at astrology.com uh she says that this particular new moon is going to make everybody feel like they're living in a movie so we're all going to kind of feel like we're rock stars you know that's that's funny because I was looking up what does the new moon in pisces mean the definition I saw was it's a time to practice the most observant self the witness self um so that's funny that you say you know it's like watching a Hollywood movie no it's like being in a movie oh being in a movie oh it's like doing Rocky Horror but you know you wanna you w to observe and not react another thing with Pisces season is it's very emotional Pisces are highly emotional highly intuitive people and and so this season can kind of bring out those emotions and some of that childlike Wonder but also some of that tendency to overreact and be a little bit too emotional and so you know it's kind of a caution to maybe be a little bit careful with that as well but I also think that one thing to take advantage of um in this particular new moon in Pisces here that we got going on utilize this to imagine the future you want because you've got that your life is a movie mixed with this is the time of starting and being intentional what are those things called where you put pictures on a board vision boards I love those those are so much fun this would be a good moon to do a vision board because you're kind of imagining that future you want so you you would made a comment to me earlier that you wanted this to be the year that you buy a house and settle down a little bit more and maybe this is the moon that you need to make a vision board about that I'm going to take that as a sign from d8 and go with it but you don't just want to imagine things in your head and and just visualize them in your head right I like to see I'm a vision board I want to see this you're very technical you could even make the background on your computer your vision board I don't know I did I've made vision boards and all sorts of you can do it in word you can do it in Google Docs slides whatever you can make vision boards online pretty easily and I have made them my computer background because part of making a vision board is you should put it in a place where you see it all the time and because that reinforces the energy you called me right out but you know maybe now is the time to to make those vision boards to to manifest that future that that you want that we all want and you know put it out there put it out there if you don't put it out there how do you expect anything to happen I'm gonna make that vision board right after we finish recording this episode you know this right nice ni I love vision boards we have done those do you remember now I don't know if this is going to make it in the episode or not but our coven at one point is kind of a bonding activity and as a Spell activity got together one month and we all brought magazines and poster board again mid90s we got together and we all did vision boards but it was more of a vision board of who we were and who we wanted to be and we didn't put our names on them but we all made them very personally again this was a a vision board of who we wanted to be who are you and who do you want to be so we all finished them we're sitting around we're smoking we're eating our food we're hanging out and my brother came over that psychic little weirdo proceeded to there was like 10 plus of us he went through and picked out every single person and matched them that's you that's you with the exact right vision board I couldn't believe it not one had a name not one had a picture of us it was all just magazine clippings and somehow he knew who each one belonged to I've Loved vision boards ever since I just I just think it that sometimes visual manifestation helps like I said sometimes just seeing something repetitively it plants the seed yeah and the act of cutting these things out searching out the pictures online or in magazines however you do it the act of putting them together however you do it is also very magical if you do that intentionally and then like shell said just just see it repeatedly especially now it's the beginning of a year it's New Beginnings it's the second new moon in the year again New Beginning setting intentions planting seeds planting seeds and it's in Pisces such a childlike sign you know so doing something childlike and Visionary like this right now is a very powerful time to do it absolutely and what better time because the warmer it gets all across the country no one is going to be sitting inside much longer we're going to be about we're going to be doing our magic in the woods and on the beaches now is a good time to wrap up some of our our personal workings and magical workings that are more indoors related right for everyone who's stuck indoors due to weather now is a great time to finish up those witchy winter projects right right including vision boards yeah I think one thing that I love about vision boards is not only the looking at it and the focusing on on what you've put on it you have to be very intentional when you're creating it what do I want right it can't be scattered right right right right it needs to be focused you need to be sure of what each picture what each symbol represents as you put it on your vision board now I've got a complaint about vision boards real quick what's that sh I remember that vision board that you're talking about and I remember having a big boat on it and I do not have a big boat to this day I'm just saying do you live on a lake um I live a mile and a half from the ocean and how long have you lived a mile and a half from the ocean only three years yeah maybe the universe said you didn't need a boat yet maybe I need a new vision board but that's actually a really good point these don't always come true exactly although I do remember when I was first learning about vision boards the person I was learning them from told me that he had made vision boards and everything and then a couple years later he had moved into this amazing aming house as he was unpacking things he found this old vision board he had done years before and it had a picture of that exact same house on it no it does happen that way but like you said sometimes you're going to put things on your vision board and they're not going to come and the reasons for that could be all sorts of things and no there were things on my vision board that panned out absolutely but I was pissed that the boat wasn't one of them that's all I'm saying yeah and maybe it wasn't time maybe she didn't really put the energy into it maybe she didn't really want one maybe the universe knew better and knew that she'd do something crazy with it cuz have you seen shell drive it's frightening but you know or maybe it could have been because I was in my early 20s asking for a $100,000 boat because sometimes what you're asking for is a little bit too unreasonable and it really reaches the wish status rather than I can get all my energies in alignment and make this happen status well I think that kind of circles back to the point of my contentment of not having the boat for my vision board a vision board is great but it needs to be semi-realistic and when I was in my early 20s a new mom having a huge ass boat in the middle of Upstate New York was not realistic so you also like Lea said there's there's wishes and then there's reality and you got to be realistic with your vision boards it's got to be stuff that you can attain and also if shell was not specific enough about this boat boats can represent all sorts of things a boat can represent travel boats can represent separation boats are on the water they can have to do with emotions you know if she's not very clear about her intentions as she put that boat on her vision board did you move a lot in that time after you made that or I did I did exactly so depending on how the universe interprets what you put there you could be in for a different ride than you intended absolutely and I think that's what happened so so you know again you got to be concise you got to be specific you know I I I stated that a few minutes ago with your intention you need to kind of be spot on with your intention careful what you wish for because you're going to get it and I wanted a boat and I got a lot of change and a lot of movement in my life shortly after that I had a relationship and I mean I I had a lot of those traits but I didn't have the damn boat and I wanted the boat but I manifested all the traits of the boat exactly exactly and sometimes that can happen despite your best intentions you know there there's you're not always going to get what you ask for no matter how hard you work for it it happens that way or how you ask for it you're not always gonna get what you want and how you asked for you might not get what you want but if you try sometimes you might get what you need but anyway so yeah this I think this is a fabulous time to do a manifesting ritual to do a vision board one of my favorite get your hands dirty act like a kid again put something cool together spell activities who doesn't love a good arts and craft spell I mean really I do think that this is a good time to think about you know maybe you're not planting the seeds quite yet that's kind of more of a ostara type activity coming up you want to start thinking about what are the seeds I want to plant that's kind of how I look at the February new moon is what seeds am I planting in the next cycle because the next cycle is seed planting time yeah it's almost like that early early potential it's a little too early in most places to start actually physically planting those seeds but you can plan out your garden you can plan out what you want you could start getting things cleaned up you know it's like the pre gardening the pre planting some folks even plot out how they're going to do their Garden on paper prior to now's the time to do that you know you're set up what seeds you're going to be planting in the next month or so yeah in most places it's still too cold to do pretty much anything if you're stuck inside now's a good time to write that journal and to make those plans what do you want this year what do you want to grow in your life this year and how will you plan on getting it you know so kind of do that planning now so that in the next couple months you can set the seeds of your intentions and where you want to go for the full for the coming year for the whole year and I think one way that that you and I have unknowingly been working on this in the last few days as we're surrounding this new moon you and I have both been coming up with future ideas that we've got going on both together and separately you know we've been working that's very true we we have been setting our intentions we've been working on some um workshops and seminars uh that we're going to be presenting and you know we might not have realized it but we were doing the same damn thing just not in a ritual cir you should see my face right now you just shell again has blown my mind because because you didn't see it that way did you I didn't even realize that's what we were doing we have been setting up so many plans in my mundane life with things that I'm doing and plans I have with work and in my magical life everything really has been working like that right now we are setting plans in motion for this next year that are that are huge in a lot of ways and we're in like the pre pre planning stages wow how synchronistic absolutely I mean one of the things I've been doing is kind of plotting out we've had some some listeners on our other podcast talk about how they want us to to be out and about and and you know talking to our listeners and and imparting some of our wisdom on our listeners in person I I definitely want to get on that that train and and we're working on getting some materials together and we're going to be workshopping on out there before you know it guys and you can come and you can listen to us ramble off just like this in person we're working on it apparently we are setting the seeds for all these wonderful different things to happen so you you should be doing that too this is a great time of year this new moon on the 20th that just happened you know now is the time to be setting those intentions and kind of ride the wave of that energy as it Cycles through to the full moon and don't feel bad if you don't know what your direction is maybe you're just like I don't even know like where should I be headed what my life is so confusing help maybe that's your intention maybe that's what you're asking for maybe you're saying I don't know where I'm going and I need help it's okay to say that absolutely but and in one option you can do and you know I always take everything back to tarot how can I not is on the new moon pull a card and be like what is my vision for the next 14 days or for the next month or whatever the cas case may be what energies will be growing in my life and pull a card and and see what you get see what you get and then focus on the energy of that card for either the next two weeks or the next uh month cycle and you know so if you just don't have a starting point or don't know don't know where to to launch off from pull a card pull a card and then focus on that card for the two weeks or the month so Pisces is the psychic sign and so now all your intu anything you put into any type of divination is going to be great right now so if you don't know where you're going and you pull that tarot card pull an oracle card absolutely and see what that springboard is it's going to launch you off of yep do whatever type of divination that you're interested in or you feel comfortable with and and see where that goes ask what your intentions are going to be ask what you should be preparing for for this year see where it leads you I love it so I'm definitely going to go out and do a vision board because I do want to get that house now now I got you stuck on a vision board you do you do my Nomad heart is is looking for a little place to settle down but yeah vision board sounds lovely I think this is a fabulous time to do that it's like everything is kind of aligned to make now a very powerful time to do that type of a spell so I'm going to go out and do one on the new moon all right so get your magazines get your scissors and go make your vision board man you know or just do it online like I'm going to come on you don't want to go out and buy the latest edition of Marie CLA well I kind of do actually how fun is it to just go get some old magazines who doesn't like the old yoga magazines and Witchcraft magazines speaking of you know everything is ritualistic and we talk about how you can find find ritual and everything I want you to close your eyes for a minute smell a magazine you know you smell those magazine pages I do distinctive smell my old library you can't get that creating a vision board online that's true that's very true so however you choose to do it get your vision board together set your intentions you know make your wishes and go out and make it all happen manifest folks get it together cuz now is the time to plant those seeds yep and uh join us next week as we get back on the broomstick
